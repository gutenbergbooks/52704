      was my betrothed. I must give some account of the circumstances under
      which she and I first met each other, so that my tale may be clear and
      complete from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long while, without knowing why, I had been restless&mdash;hungry,
      without knowing for what I hungered. Teaching music to support myself, I
      employed all of the day that was not thus occupied in practicing on my own
      behalf. My life consequently was a solitary one, numbering but few
      acquaintances and not any friends. In my short intervals of leisure I was
      generally too tired to seek out society; I was too obscure and unimportant
      to be sought out in turn. Yet, young and of an ardent temperament,
      doubtless it was natural that I should have been dimly conscious of
      something wanting; and, not prone to selfanalysis, doubtless it was also
      natural that I should have had no distinct conception of what the wanting
      something was. Besides, it would soon be summer. The soft air and bright
      sunshine of spring awoke a myriad vague desires in my heart. I strove in
      vain to understand them. They were all the more poignant because they had
      no definite object. Twenty times a day I would catch myself heaving a
      mighty sigh; but asking, &ldquo;What are you sighing for?&rdquo; I had to answer, &ldquo;Who
      can tell?&rdquo; My thoughts got into the habit of wandering away would fly off
      to cloud-land at the most inopportune moments. While my pupils were
      blundering through their exercises their master would fall to thinking of
      other things&mdash;afterward impossible to remember what. From morning to
      night I went about with a feeling of expectancy&mdash;an event was
      impending&mdash;presently a change would come over the tenor of my life. I
      waited anxiously, on the alert for its first premonitory symptom.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had taken to strolling through the streets at evening. One delicious
      night in May, I found myself leaning over the terrace at the eastern
      extremity of Fifty-first street. The moon had just risen, a huge red disk,
      out of the mist and smoke across the river, and was turning the waves to
      burnished copper. Through the open windows of the neighborhood escaped the
      sounds of quiet talk, of laughter, of piano playing. Now and then a low
      dark shape, with a single bright light gleaming like a jewel at its side,
      and spars and masts sharply outlined against the sky, slipped silently
      past upon the water. The atmosphere was quick with the warmth and the
      scent of spring. I stood there motionless, penetrated by the unspeakable
      beauty of the scene. The moon climbed higher and higher, and gradually
      exchanged its ruddy tint for its ordinary metallic blue. By and by
      somebody with a sweet soprano voice, in one of the nearest houses, began
      to sing the <i>Ave Maria</i> of Gounod. The impassioned music seemed made
      for the time and place. It caught the soul of the moment and gave it
      voice. I could feel my heart swelling with the crescendo: and then how it
      leaped and thrilled when the singer reached that glorious climax of the
      song, &ldquo;<i>Nunc et in hora mortis nostrae!</i>&rdquo; At that instant, as if
      released from a spell, I drew a long breath and looked around. Then for
      the first time I saw Veronika Pathzuol. Her eyes and mine met for the
      first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady, young, tall, beautiful, strange, and sad&rdquo;&mdash;and pale. Her
      face was pale, like an angel&rsquo;s. The wealth of black hair above it and the
      dark eyes that gazed sadly out of it rendered the pallor more intense. But
      it was not the pallor of ill-health; it was the pallor of a luminous white
      soul. As I beheld her standing there in the moonlight scarcely a yard away
      from me, I knew all at once what it was my heart had craved for so long a
      while. I knew at once, by the sudden pain that pierced it, that my heart
      had been waiting for this lady all its life. I did not stop to reflect and
      determine. Had I done so, most likely&mdash;nay, most certain-ly&mdash;I
      should never have had to tell this story. The words flew to my tongue and
      were spoken as soon as thought.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, how beautiful, how beautiful!&rdquo;
       I exclaimed, meaning her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very beautiful,&rdquo; I heard her voice, clear and soft, respond. &ldquo;It is
      almost a pain, the feeling such intense beauty gives,&rdquo;&mdash;meaning the
      scene before us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet this is every-day, hum-drum, commercial New York,&rdquo; added another
      voice, one that jarred upon my hearing like the scraping of a contre-bass
      after a cadenza by the flute. She was leaning on the arm of a man. I was
      at the verge of being straightway jealous, when I observed that his hair
      and beard were snowy and that his face was wrinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got into conversation without ceremony. Nature had introduced us. Our
      common appreciation of the loveliness round about broke the ice and
      provided a topic for speech. After her first impulsive utterance, Veronika
      said little. But the old man was voluble, evidently glad of the
      opportunity to express his ideas to a new person. And I was more than glad
      to listen, because while doing so I could gaze upon her face to my heart&rsquo;s
      content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something that I had said, in reply to a remark of his upon the singing of
      the <i>Ave</i>, caused him to ask, &ldquo;Ah, you understand music? You are a
      musician&mdash;yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I play the violin,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear, Veronika?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Our friend plays the violin! My dear
      sir, you must do us the favor of playing for us before we part. Do not be
      surprised&mdash;pay no heed to the formalities. Is not music a
      free-masonry? Come, you shall try your skill upon an Amati. Such an
      evening as this must have an appropriate ending. Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without allowing me time to protest, had I been disposed to do so, he
      grasped my arm and started off. He kept on talking as we marched along. I
      had no attention for what he said. My mind was divided between delight at
      my good-fortune, and query as to what its upshot would be. We had not far
      to go. A few doors to the west of First avenue he turned up a stoop. It
      was a modest apartment-house. We climbed to the topmost story and stood
      still in the dark while he fumbled for a match. Then he lighted the gas
      and said, &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo; The room was bare and cheerless. A chromo or two
      sufficed to decorate the walls. The furniture&mdash;a few chairs and a
      center-table&mdash;was stiff and shabby. The carpet was threadbare.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a piano occupied a corner; and the floor, the table, and the chairs
      were littered thick with music. So I felt at home. As I look back at that
      meager little parlor now, it is transformed into a sanctuary. There the
      deepest moments of two lives were spent. Yet to-day strangers dwell in it;
      come and go, laugh and chatter, eat, drink, and make merry between its
      walls, all unconcernedly, never pausing to bestow a thought upon the sad,
      sweet lady whose presence once hallowed the place, whose tears more than
      once watered the floor over which they tread with indifferent footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man lighted the gas and said, &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; making obedience
      possible by clearing a chair of the music it held. Then scrutinizing my
      face: &ldquo;You are a Jew, are you not?&rdquo; he inquired, in his quick, nervous
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;by birth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by faith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am not orthodox, not a zealot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neuman&mdash;Ernest Neuman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mine, Tikulski&mdash;Baruch. You see we are of one race&mdash;<i>the</i>
      race&mdash;the chosen race! Neither am I orthodox. I keep <i>Yom Kippur</i>,
      to be sure, but I have no conscientious scruples against shell-fish, and
      indeed the &lsquo;succulent oyster&rsquo; is especially congenial to my palate. This,&rdquo;
       with a wave of the hand toward Veronika, &ldquo;this is my niece, Miss Pathzuol&mdash;P-a-t-h-z-u-o-1&mdash;pronounced
      Patchuol&mdash;Hungarian name. Her mother was my sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Veronika dropped a courtesy. Her eyes seemed to plead, &ldquo;Do not laugh at my
      uncle. He is eccentric; but be charitable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Veronika, show Mr. Neuman your music and find something that you can
      play together. I will go fetch the violin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you play?&rdquo; asked Veronika. Her voice quavered. She was timid,
      as indeed it was natural she should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I said, my own voice not as firm as I could have wished.
      &ldquo;What have you got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We commenced at the top of a big pile of music and had settled upon the
      prize song from the Meistersinger&mdash;not then as hackneyed as it is at
      present, not then the victim of every passable amateur&mdash;when Mr.
      Tikulski came back. It was in truth an Amati that he brought. The
      discolored, half obliterated label within said so&mdash;but the label
      might have lied. The strong, tense, ringing tone that it emitted in
      response to the <i>A</i> which Veronika gave me said so also&mdash;and
      that did not lie. I played as best I could. Rather, the music played
      itself. With a violin under my chin, I lapse into semi-consciousness, lose
      my identity. Another spirit impels my arm, pouring itself out through the
      voice of my instrument. Not until silence is restored do I realize that I
      have been the performer. While the music is going on my personality is
      annihilated. With the final note I seem to &ldquo;come, to,&rdquo; as one does from a
      trance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came to this time it was to be embraced by my host with an
      effusiveness that overwhelmed me. &ldquo;Ah, you are a true musician,&rdquo; he cried,
      releasing me from his arms. &ldquo;You have the inspiration. Veronika, speak,
      tell him how nobly he has played.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak, I can&rsquo;t tell him,&rdquo; answered Veronika, &ldquo;it has taken away
      all power of speech.&rdquo; But she gave me a glance, allowed her eyes to stay
      with mine for a long moment. A fire had been smoldering in my breast from
      the first; at these words, at this glance, it burst into flame. A great
      light inundated my soul. I felt the arteries tingling to my very finger
      tips. I started tuning up, to hide my emotion. Then we played the march
      from Raff&rsquo;s Lenore.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am afraid my agitation marred the effect of Raffs diamatic composition.
      At any rate, the plaudits were faint when I had done. After a breathing
      spell Mr. Tikulski told Veronika to sing. She played her own accompaniment
      while I stood by to turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be useless for me to try to qualify her singing. Whatever
      critical faculty I had was stricken dumb. I can only say that she sang a
      song in French (an old, old romance, till then unfamiliar to me; so old
      that the composer&rsquo;s name has been forgotten) in a splendid contralto
      voice, and that it seemed as if she was playing upon the inmost tissue of
      my life, so keenly I felt each note. I quite forgot to turn the page at
      the proper place, and Veronika had to prompt me. It was a little thing,
      and yet I remember as vividly as if from yesterday the nod of the head and
      the inflection with which she said, &ldquo;Turn, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Le temps fait passer l&rsquo;amour</i>,&rsquo;.rdquo; repeated Mr. Tikulski: it was the
      last line of the song. &ldquo;Veronika, bring some wine. <i>Le vin fait passer
      le temps</i>,&rdquo; and he chuckled at his joke. Another small thing that I
      remember vividly is how Tikulski, as she left the room, posed his
      forefinger upon his Adam&rsquo;s-apple and said, &ldquo;She carries a &lsquo;cello here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on to this effect:&mdash;Veronika, as I already knew, was his
      niece. He also was a violinist: more than that, he was a composer, though
      as yet unpublished. With the self-conceit too characteristic of musical
      people, he told me how he was engaged upon &ldquo;an epoch-making symphony&rdquo;&mdash;had
      been engaged upon it for the last dozen years, would be engaged upon it
      for the dozen years to come. Then the world should have it, and he, not
      having lived in vain, would die content. Veronika was now one-and-twenty.
      During her childhood he had played in an orchestra and arranged
      dance-music and done other hackwork to earn money for her maintenance and
      education. She had received the best musical training, instrumental and
      vocal, that could be had in New York. Now he had turned the tables. Now he
      did nothing but compose&mdash;reserved all his time and strength for his
      masterpiece. Veronika had become the breadwinner. She taught on an average
      seven hours a day. She sang regularly in church and synagogue, and at
      concerts and musicals whenever she got a chance.&mdash;Veronika reentered
      the room bearing cakes and wine. She sat down near to us, and I forgot
      every thing in the contemplation of her beautiful, sad, strange face. Her
      eyes were bottomless. Far, far in their liquid depths the spirit shone
      like a star. All the history of Israel was in her glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every touch of constraint had vanished from her bearing. She spoke with me
      as with one whom she knew well. I could scarcely believe that only an hour
      ago we had been ignorant of each other&rsquo;s existence. We discussed music and
      found that our tastes were in accord. We compared notes on teaching and
      exchanged anecdotes about our respective pupils. She said among other
      things that more than half the money she earned her uncle sent to Germany
      for the relief of his widowed sister and her offspring, who were extremely
      poor! Her every syllable clove my heart like an arrow. I grew hot with
      indignation to think of this frail, delicate maiden slaving her life away
      in order that her relations might fatten in idleness and her fanatic of an
      uncle work at his impossible symphony. My fists clenched convulsively as I
      fancied her exposed to the ups and downs, the hardships, the humiliations,
      of a music-teacher&rsquo;s career. I took no pains to regulate my manner: and,
      if she had possessed the least trace of sophistication, she would have
      guessed that I loved her from every modulation of my voice. Love her I
      did. I had already loved her for an eternity&mdash;from the moment my eyes
      had first encountered hers in the moonlight by the terrace.&mdash;But it
      was getting late. It would not do for me to wear my welcome out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, stay,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Tikulski, &ldquo;you have not heard <i>me</i> play
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you must hear my uncle play,&rdquo; said Veronika. &ldquo;The <i>Adagio</i>
      of Handel? she asked of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, child,&rdquo; he answered, with a tinge of impatience, &ldquo;the minuet&mdash;from
      my own symphony,&rdquo; aiming the last words at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Veronika returned to the piano. They began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the old man played superbly. His selection was a marvelous
      finger-exercise&mdash;but of true music it contained none save that which
      he informed it with by the fervor of his performance. He was a perfect
      executant. His tone was equal to Wilhelm&rsquo;s. It was a pity, a great pity,
      that he should fritter himself away in the endeavor to compose. Veronika
      and I said as much as this to each other with our eyes when finally his
      bow had reached a standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you will insist on going,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you must at least agree to
      come as soon as possible again. This is Wednesday. We are always at home
      on Wednesday evening. The other nights of the week Veronika is engaged:
      Monday and Tuesday, lessons; Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday,
      rehearsals and services at church and synagogue. The church is in Hoboken:
      she doesn&rsquo;t get home till eleven o&rsquo;clock. So on Wednesday we will see you
      without fail&mdash;yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I looked forward, Wednesday seemed a million years away. &ldquo;What an old
      brute you are to make that child track over to Hoboken two nights a week!&rdquo;
       I thought; and said, &ldquo;Thank you. You are very kind. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Veronika gave me her hand. The long slim fingers clasped mine cordially
      and sent an electric thrill into my heart.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> SUPPOSE it is
      needless to say that I passed a sleepless night, haunted till morning by
      Veronika&rsquo;s face and voice; that I tossed endlessly from pillow to pillow,
      going over in memory every circumstance from our meeting to our parting;
      that I built a hundred wondrous castles in the air and that Veronika
      presided as chatelaine in each. I thought I should boil over with rage
      when I dwelt upon the enforced drudgery of her life. I could hardly
      contain myself for sheer joy when I made bold to say, &ldquo;Why, it is not
      impossible that some day she may love you&mdash;not impossible that some
      day she may consent to become your wife.&rdquo; One doubt, the inevitable one,
      harassed me: Had I a clear field? Was there perchance another suitor there
      before me? Perhaps her affections were already spoken. Still, on the
      whole, probably not. For, where had he kept himself during the evening?
      Surely, if he had existed at all, he would have been at her side. Yet on
      the other hand she was so beautiful, it could scarcely be believed that
      she had attained the age of one-and-twenty without taking some heart
      captive. And that sad, mysterious expression in her eyes&mdash;how had it
      come about except through love?&mdash;Thus between despair and hope I
      swung, pendulum-like, all night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dawn filtered through the window. &ldquo;Thursday!&rdquo; I muttered. &ldquo;Seven days
      still to be dragged through&mdash;but then!&rdquo;&mdash;Imagination faltered at
      the prospect. I went about my usual business in a sort of intoxication. My
      footstep had acquired an unwonted briskness. Every five minutes my heart
      jumped into my throat and lost a beat. But my pupils suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was more inclined to absent-mindedness than ever. At dusk I revisited
      the terrace despite the rain that fell in torrents, and walked by her
      house and lived through the whole happy episode again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be assured I was punctual when at last Wednesday came. I remember, as I
      mounted the staircase that led to their abode, an absurd fear beset me.
      What if they had moved away?
    </p>
    <p>
      What if I should not find her after this interminable week of waiting? My
      hand shook as I pulled the bell-knob. I was nerving myself for the worst
      in the interval that elapsed before the door was opened.&mdash;The door
      was opened by Veronika herself!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, good-evening. We were expecting you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stammered a response. My temples were throbbing madly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Veronika led me into the dining-room. They were still at table. I began to
      apologize. Tikulski stopped me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come just at the proper moment,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You shall now have
      occasion to confess that my niece is as good a cook as she is a player.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have dined,&rdquo; I protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can make room for one morsel more&mdash;for a mere taste of
      pudding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Veronika, with infinite grace, was moving about the room, getting a plate
      and napkin. Then with her own hands she helped me to the pudding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that flavor do her credit?&rdquo; cried Tikulski. &ldquo;It is a melody
      materialized, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We all laughed; and I ate my pudding at perfect ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope Mr. Neuman has brought his violin,&rdquo; said Veronika, &ldquo;for then we
      can have a first and second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I took that liberty,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And afterward, adjourning to the parlor, I played second to the old man&rsquo;s
      first for an hour or more&mdash;reading at sight from his own manuscript
      music, which was not the lightest of tasks. Then Veronika sang to us. And
      then, as it was extremely hot, Mr. Tikulski proposed that we betake
      ourselves to a concert garden in the neighborhood and spend the rest of
      the evening in the open air. We sat at a round table under an ailanthus
      tree, and watched the people come and go, and listened to light tunes
      discoursed by a tolerable band, and by and by had a delicious little
      supper; and while Mr. Tikulski puffed a huge cigar, Veronika and I enjoyed
      a long, delightful confidential talk in which our minds got wonderfully
      close together, and during which one scrap of information dropped from her
      lips that afforded me infinite relief. Speaking of her nocturnal
      pilgrimages to Hoboken, she said, &ldquo;I go over by myself in the summer
      because it is still light; but coming home, the organist takes me to the
      ferry, where uncle meets me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; I concluded, &ldquo;there is no one ahead of me; for if there were, of
      course he would be her escort.&rdquo; And I lost no time about putting in a word
      for myself. &ldquo;I am very anxious to hear you sing in church,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Your
      voice can not attain its full effect between the narrow walls of a
      parlor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it was agreed that I should call upon them Sunday afternoon and that
      we should all three take a walk in Central Park, Veronika and I afterward
      going to Hoboken together. Music had, indeed, proved a freemasonry, so far
      as we were concerned. This was only our second interview; and already we
      treated each other like old and intimate friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thunder shower broke above our heads on the way back to Fifty-first
      street, and in default of an umbrella, I lent Veronika my handkerchief to
      protect her hat. She returned it to me at the door of her house, and lo!
      it was freighted with a faint, sweet perfume that it had caught from
      contact with her. I stowed the handkerchief religiously in my pocket, and
      for a week afterward it still retained a trace of the same dainty odor. It
      was a touchstone, by means of which I could call her up bodily before me
      whenever I desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I sat alone in my bed-chamber that night, I acknowledged that I was
      more deeply in love than ever. The reader would not wonder at this if he
      could form a true conception of Veronika&rsquo;s presence. I wish I could
      describe her&mdash;that is, render in words the impression wrought upon me
      by her face, and her voice, and her manner, and the things she said. I am
      not accustomed to expressing such matters in words, but with my violin I
      should have no sort of difficulty. If I wanted to give utterance to my
      idea of Veronika, all I should have to do would be to take my violin and
      play this heavenly melody from Chopin&rsquo;s Impromptu in C-sharp minor:&mdash;Sotto
      voce.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0003" id="linkimage-0003"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0030.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      It seems almost as though Chopin must have had Veronika in mind when he
      composed it. Its color, its passion, its vague dreamy sadness, and withal
      its transparent simplicity, make it for me a perfect musical portrait.
      Those were the traits which most constantly and conspicuously abode in my
      thought of her. Her simplicity, her child-like simplicity, and her
      naturalness, and the serene purity of her soul, made her as different from
      other women that I had seen&mdash;though, to be sure, I had seen but few
      women except as I passed them in the street or rode with them in the
      horse-car&mdash;made her as different from those I had seen, at any rate,
      as a lily plucked on the hillside is different from a hothouse flower, as
      daylight is different from gaslight, as Schubert&rsquo;s music is different from
      Liszt&rsquo;s. In every thing and from every point of view, she was simple and
      natural and serene. Her great pale face, and the dark eyes, and the smile
      that came and went like a melody across her lips, and the way she wore her
      hair, and the way she dressed, and the way she played, sang, spoke, and
      her gestures, and the low, sad, musical laughter that I heard only once or
      twice from the beginning to the end&mdash;all were simple, and natural,
      and serene. And yet there was a mystery attaching to each of them, a
      something beyond my comprehension, a something that tinged my love for her
      with awe. A mystery that would neither be defined nor penetrated nor
      ignored, brooded over her, as the perfume broods over a rose. I doubt
      whether an American woman can be like this unless she is older and has had
      certain experiences of her own. Veronika had not had sufficient experience
      of her own to account for what I have described: but she was a Jewess, and
      all the experience of the Jewish race, all the martyrdom of the scattered
      hosts, were hers by inheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter how I was occupied, whether teaching, or practicing, or reading,
      or writing, or walking, or talking to other people, I was always conscious
      of the love of Veronika astir in my heart. Just as through all the
      vicissitudes of a fugue the subject melody will survive in one form or
      another and be at no minute altogether silenced, so through all the
      changes of my busy day the thought of Veronika lingered in my mind. I can
      not tell how completely the whole aspect of the world had been altered
      since the night I first saw her standing in the moonlight. It was as if my
      life up to that moment had been passed beneath gray skies, and suddenly
      the clouds had dispersed and the sunshine flooded the earth. A myriad
      things became plain and clear that had been invisible until now, and old
      things acquired a new significance. My heart welled with tenderness for
      all living creatures&mdash;the overflow of the tenderness it had for her.
      All my senses, all my capacities for pain and pleasure, were more acute
      than before. Suddenly music, which had been my art, became my religion:
      she had glorified it by her devotion. I looked forward to my next visit
      with her as a benighted traveler looks forward to the glowing window that
      promises rest and shelter: only in my case the light illuminated my whole
      pathway and made the progress toward its source a constant delight instead
      of a perfunctory labor. But this is the common story of a man in love, and
      stands without telling. Suffice it that before our acquaintance was a
      month old I had got upon the most intimate terms with Mr. Tikulski and
      Veronika, spending not only every Wednesday evening at their house but
      also each Sunday afternoon, and accompanying her to Hoboken as regularly
      as she had to go. Never was there a prouder man than I at those junctures
      when, with her hand pressed tightly under my arm, I felt that she was
      trusting herself entirely to my charge and that I was answerable for her
      safety and well-being. The Hoboken ferry-boats became to my thinking
      vastly more interesting than the most romantic of Venetian gondolas; and
      to this day I can not sniff the peculiar stuffy odor that always pervades
      a ferry-boat cabin without being transported back across the years to that
      happy, happy time. I actually blessed the necessity that forced her to
      journey so far for her livelihood; and it was with an emphatic pang that I
      listened to the plans which she and Tikulski were prone to discuss whereby
      she was shortly to get an engagement nearer home: though the sight of her
      pale, tired cheek reproached me the moment after. On her side she made no
      concealment of a most cordial regard for me. Her face always lighted up at
      my arrival; she was always eager to share her ideas with me and to call
      forth my opinion of her work, appearing pleased by my praise and impressed
      by my criticism. She set me an admirable example of frankness. She would
      say precisely what she thought of my renditions, sparing not their
      blemishes and indicating how an effective point might be improved.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as yet I had not dared to hope that she loved, or was even in train to
      love me. So as yet I had not intended to speak of love at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one day&mdash;one Sunday late in June&mdash;she proposed to sing me a
      song she had just been learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From <i>Le Désert</i> of Felicien David,&rdquo; she said, handing me the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the &ldquo;<i>O, belle nuit, O, sois plus lente</i>,&rdquo; originally written
      for tenor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hardly think it would suit your voice,&rdquo; I said, running over the
      music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither did I, at first; but listen, anyway.&rdquo; And she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice had never been in better order, had never been more resonant,
      never more electric. Contrary to my misgivings, the song suited it
      perfectly, afforded its &lsquo;cello quality full scope. She sang with an
      enthusiasm, a precision, a delicacy of shading, that carried me away. As
      the last tender note melted on her lips, she swung around on the
      piano-stool and looked a question with her great, dark, serious eyes. I
      know not what possessed me. A blindness fell upon my sight. My heart gave
      a mighty bound. In another instant I was at her side and had caught her&mdash;my
      darling&mdash;in my arms. In another instant she was sobbing her life out
      upon my shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by, after the first stress of our emotion had subsided, I mustered
      voice to say, &ldquo;Then, Veronika, you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand nestled in mine by way of answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her as well I could how I had loved her from the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when you turned to me there on the terrace and
      spoke, it was as if a light broke into my life. And it has been the same
      ever since&mdash;my heart has been full of light. Oh, I have wanted you so
      much! I was afraid you did not care for me. Why have you waited so long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No need of putting down my answer nor the rest of our dialogue. When Mr.
      Tikulski came back I confessed every thing. He asked but a single
      question, imposed but a single condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      I replied that I earned enough by my teaching to support him and her
      comfortably and to contribute toward the maintenance of the widow and her
      brood in Germany. Furthermore, I had solid grounds for expecting to earn
      more next winter. There would be an opening for me in the Symphony and
      Philharmonic Societies, and as I was gaining something of a reputation I
      might reasonably demand a higher price for my lessons. It was arranged
      that we should be married the first week in August.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our journey to Hoboken was all too short that night. Never had horse-car
      or ferry-boat advanced with such velocity before. As we left the church
      she asked, &ldquo;Did you notice how my voice trembled in my solo?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It only added to its effect,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Were you nervous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I was happy, so happy that I could not control my voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, but I had a full heart as I walked home that night. The future was all
      radiant radiant beyond my wildest dream. It frightened me. Such perfect
      bliss seemed scarcely possible, seemed too great and glorious to last. And
      yet had not Veronika&rsquo;s own lips promised it? and sealed the promise with a
      kiss that burned still where she had placed it? It was useless for me to
      go to bed; it was useless for me to stay in the house. I put on my hat and
      went out and spent the night pacing up and down before her door. And as
      soon as the morning was far enough advanced I rang the bell and invited
      myself to breakfast with her; and after breakfast I helped her to wash the
      dishes, to Mr. Tikulski&rsquo;s unutterable disapproval&mdash;it was
      &ldquo;unteeknified,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and after that I accompanied her as far as
      the first house where she had to give a lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      While writing the above I had almost forgotten. Now I remember. I must
      stop for a space to get used to remembering again that she is dead.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>ES, she is dead.
      That is the truth. If truth is good, as men proclaim it to be, then
      goodness is intrinsically cruel. That Veronika is dead is the truth which
      lies like a hot coal upon my consciousness, and goads me along as I tell
      this tale. And the manner of her death and the speediness of it&mdash;I
      must tell all.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, although I know her to be dead, although I repeat to myself a
      hundred times a day, &ldquo;She is dead, dead, dead,&rdquo; and although, God help me,
      I think I realize too well that she is dead, yet to this day I can
      scarcely bring myself to believe it. Truth as it is, it seems to be in
      utter contradiction to the rest of truth. Even those who have abandoned
      faith in Religion, still profess faith in Nature, saying, &ldquo;Nature is
      provident, beneficent, and wise; Nature is alive with beauty.&rdquo; And at most
      times, it seems as if these assertions were not to be contested. Yet, how
      can they be true when Nature contained the possibility of Veronika&rsquo;s
      death? How can Nature be wise, and yet have permitted that maiden life to
      be destroyed?&mdash;provident, and yet have flung away her finest product?&mdash;beneficent,
      and yet have torn bleeding from my life all that made my life worth
      living?&mdash;beautiful, and yet have quenched the beautifying light of
      Veronika&rsquo;s presence, and hushed the voice that made the world musical? The
      mere fact that Veronika could die gives the lie to the Nature-worshipers.
      In the light of that fact, or rather in the darkness of it, it is mockery
      to sing songs of praise to Nature.&mdash;That is why it is so hard for me
      to believe&mdash;to believe a thing which annihilates the harmony of the
      universe, and proclaims the optimism of the philosophers to be a delusion,
      a superstition. How could I believe my senses if I should hear Christine
      Nilsson utter a hideous false note? So is it hard for me to believe that
      Nature has allowed Veronika to die. And yet it is the truth, the
      unmistakable, irrevocable, relentless truth.

      I suppose all lovers are happy: but it does not seem possible that other
      lovers can ever have had such unmitigated happiness as ours was&mdash;happiness
      so keen as almost to be a pain. The light of love that burst suddenly into
      our lives, and filled each cranny full to overflowing, was so pure and
      bright as almost to blind us. The happiness was all the keener, the light
      all the brighter, because of the hardship and the monotony of our daily
      tasks. If we had been rich, if we had had leisure and friends and many
      resources for diversion, then most likely our delight in each other would
      not have been so great. But as we were&mdash;poor, hard worked, and alone
      in the world&mdash;we found all the happiness we had, in ourselves, in
      communing together; and happiness concentrated, was proportionately more
      intense. The few hours in the week which we were permitted to spend side
      by side glittered like diamonds against the dull background of the rest.
      And we improved them to the full. We called upon each fleeting moment to
      stay and perpetuate itself; and we could not understand how Faust had had
      to wait so many years before he could do the same. The season was divine,
      clear skies and balmy weather day after day, and the Park being easily
      accessible, we could imagine ourselves among the green fields of the
      country whenever the fancy seized us. I believe that as a matter of fact
      the turf of the common was sadly parched and brown; but we were not
      critical so long as we could wander over it hand in hand. Then, our
      characters were perfectly accorded; their unison was faultless. Each
      called for the other, needed the other, as the dominant chord calls for
      and needs its tonic. We had not a hope, a fear, an ambition, an
      aspiration, but it was shared equally between us. Our art was a mutual
      passion which we pursued together. When Veronika was seated at the piano
      and I stood at her side with my violin at my shoulder, our cup of
      contentment was full to the brim. Nothing more was wanting. I remember,
      one evening, in the middle of a phrase, her fingers faltered and she
      wheeled around and lifted her eyes upon my face.&mdash;&ldquo;What is the
      matter, darling?&rdquo; I asked.&mdash;&ldquo;I only want to look at you to realize
      that it isn&rsquo;t a dream,&rdquo; she answered.&mdash;And yet she is dead.
    </p>

      June and half July had wound away; in little more than a fortnight our
      wedding would be celebrated. The night was sultry, and she and I sat
      together by an open window. Her uncle was absent: an idea had come to him
      just before dinner, she explained, and according to his custom he had gone
      out to walk the streets until he had mastered it. We were by no means
      sorry to be alone. We had plenty to talk about; but even without talking
      it was marvelously pleasant to sit together and think the happy thoughts
      that filled our minds and listen to the subdued sounds of human life that
      came in by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Veronika had shown me some of her bridal outfit, telling how she had
      worked at it in her short snatches of leisure. We took as much pleasure in
      the contemplation of this modest little trousseau as though it had boasted
      all the rubies and silken fabrics of the Indies. This set us to talking of
      the future and making plans. And afterward we talked of the past. We spoke
      of how strange it was that we should have come together in the way we had&mdash;by
      the merest accident, as it seemed; and we doubted if it was indeed an
      accident, if destiny had not purposely guided our footsteps that memorable
      night.&mdash;&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;if uncle and I had been but a few
      moments earlier or later, we never should have seen each other at all.
      Think of the terrible risk we ran! Think if we had never known each
      other!&rdquo; and her fingers tightened around mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;that I should have spoken to you, a strange lady,
      and that you should have answered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seemed perfectly natural for me to answer; I had done so before I
      stopped to think. But afterward I was ashamed; I was afraid you might
      think it indelicate. But, somehow, the words spoke themselves. I am glad
      of it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do believe God&rsquo;s hand was in it! I do believe it was all pre-ordained
      in heaven. I believe that our Guardian Angel prompted me to speak and you
      to answer. It can&rsquo;t be that we, who were made for each other, were left to
      find it out by a mere perilous chance&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t credible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But nobody except myself&mdash;not even you, can understand how like a
      miracle it all is to me, because nobody else can know how much I needed
      you. Nobody else can know how dreary and empty my life was before you
      came, or how completely you have filled it and gladdened it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here we stopped talking for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by she resumed, &ldquo;I think that music differs from the other arts. I
      think the musician instinctively needs a companion worker. I know that in
      the old days when I would play or sing, my heart seemed to cry out
      continually for some one to come and share its feeling. Perhaps this was
      because music is the most emotional of the arts, the most sympathetic.
      Really, sometimes I could not bear to touch the piano, the pain of being
      alone was so acute. Of course I had my uncle, a most thorough musician;
      but I wanted somebody who would feel precisely as I did, and he did not.
      He always analyzed and criticised, never allowed himself to be carried
      away, never forgot the intellectual side of the things I would play. But
      now&mdash;now that you are with me, my music is a constant source of joy.
      And then, the thought that we are going to work together all our lives,
      the thought of the music we are going to make together&mdash;oh, it is too
      great, it takes my breath away! I don&rsquo;t dare to believe it. I am afraid
      all the time that something will happen to prevent it coming true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again for a while we did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again by and by she resumed, &ldquo;And then you can not know how lonely I was
      in other ways, how I longed for a little affection, a little tenderness.
      Of course uncle is very good, has always been very good to me; but do you
      think it was ungrateful for me to want a little more affection than he
      gave me? I mean a little more <i>manifest</i> affection; because I know
      that in the bottom of his heart he loves me very warmly. But I longed for
      somebody to <i>show</i> a little care for me, and uncle is very
      undemonstrative&mdash;he is so absorbed in his symphony, and then
      sometimes he is exceedingly severe. When I would get home at night it was
      so dreary not to have any one to speak to about the trials of the day&mdash;not
      to have any one who would sympathize and understand. You see, other girls
      have their mothers or their brothers and sisters and friends: but I had
      nobody except my uncle; and he was so much older, and regarded things so
      differently, that I do not think it was unnatural for me to wish for some
      one else. Besides, I had so much responsibility; I felt so weak and
      helpless. I thought, what if something should happen to my uncle! or what
      if I should get sick and be unable to teach! Oh, the rest and security
      that you brought to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What I replied&mdash;a mass of broken sentences&mdash;was too incoherent
      to bear recording.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, the mere physical fatigue&mdash;day after day, work, work,
      work, and never any respite. Of course, every body has to work, but almost
      every body has a holiday now and then; and I never had a single day that I
      could call all my own. In winter it was hardest. No matter how tired I
      was, I had to be up and off giving lessons even if the snow was ankle
      deep. And the ice in the river made it such hard work getting to Hoboken,
      made the journey so very long. I had to do the housework too, you know. We
      couldn&rsquo;t afford to keep a servant, on account of the money we had to send
      abroad. When I would come home all fagged out I had to clean the rooms and
      cook the dinner; though I am afraid that sometimes I did not more than
      half do my duty. Sometimes I would let the dust lie for a week on the
      mantle-piece. And every day was just the same as the day that had gone
      before. It was like traveling in a circle. When I would go to bed at night
      my weariness would be all the harder because of the thought, &lsquo;To-morrow
      will be just the same, the same round of lessons, the same dead fatigue,
      the same monotonous drudgery from beginning to end.&rsquo; And as I saw no
      promise of change, as I thought it would be the same all my life, I could
      not help asking what the use was of having been born. Wasn&rsquo;t I a dreadful
      grumbler? Yet, what could I do? I think it is natural when one is young to
      long for something to look forward to, for just a little pleasure and just
      a little companionship. But then you came, and every thing was altered. Do
      you remember in the Creation the wonderful awakening one feels when they
      sing, &lsquo;And the Lord said, Let there be light,&rsquo; very low, and then with a
      mighty burst of sound, &lsquo;And there was <i>LIGHT?</i>&rsquo; Do you remember how
      one&rsquo;s heart leaps and seems to grow big in one&rsquo;s breast? It was like that
      when you came to me. I used to wonder why I had ever felt unhappy or
      discontented. The mere prospect of seeing you at the week&rsquo;s end made my
      heart sing from morning to night. It gave a motive, an object, to my life&mdash;made
      me feel that I was working to a purpose, that I should have my reward. I
      had been growing hard and indifferent, even indifferent to music. But now
      I began to love my music more than ever: and no matter how tired I might
      be, when I had a moment of leisure I would sit down and practice so as to
      be able to play well for you. Music seemed to express all the unutterable
      feeling that you inspired me with. One day I had sung the <i>Ave Maria</i>
      of Cherubini to you, and you said, &lsquo;It is so religious&mdash;it expresses
      precisely the emotions one experiences in a church.&rsquo; But for me it
      expressed rather the emotions a woman has when she is in the presence of
      the man she loves. All the time I had no idea that you would ever feel in
      the same way toward me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My kisses silenced her. Afterward she sang from Pergolese&rsquo;s <i>Stabat
      Mater</i>, and played a medley of bits from Chopin: until, looking at my
      watch, I saw it was nearing midnight. Time for me to go away. But her
      uncle had not yet come home. I did not like to leave her alone. I said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is nothing,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;It always happens when he has one
      of his ideas. Very likely he won&rsquo;t come in till morning. I am quite
      accustomed to it, and not a bit afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that event,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;I certainly ought to go. It may embarrass
      her, my staying so late; and besides, she needs the sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started to say good-by. Our parting was hard. Again and again, as I
      reached the door, I turned back and began anew. But at last I found myself
      in the street. I looked up at the parlor window, and remained on the
      curbstone until I saw her close the sash and pull the shade, and the light
      being extinguished, knew that she had gone to her bedroom. Then I set my
      face toward home.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had never loved her as I loved her now. Every lover will understand that
      what she had said during the evening had added fuel to the fire. My
      tenderness for her had increased a hundredfold. All my life should be
      dedicated to soothing her and protecting her and making her glad. The
      tired child should find rest and peace in my arms. To think of how she had
      been exposed to the noise and the heat and the glare of the fierce
      work-a-day world! Ah, Veronika, Veronika, I wanted, late as it was, to
      return and pour out the yearning of my spirit at your feet. Why had I left
      her at all? Each heart-beat seemed to speak her name. And when the
      knowledge that in a fortnight we were really going to be married, that I
      was really going to have the right to be to her what I wished&mdash;when
      that knowledge flashed in upon me, I had to turn away lest it should
      overwhelm me. I could not contemplate it any more than I could have gazed
      straight upon the sun.&mdash;Finally I fell asleep and dreamed that I was
      seated at her side, caressing her brow and emptying my life into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I awoke next morning with a start. My first sensation was one of anxiety
      and unrest. As I dressed, this feeling intensified. I had a presentiment
      that something had gone wrong. I tried to reason it away. The more I
      reasoned, the stronger it waxed. I wanted to see her and satisfy myself
      that every thing was right. It was eight o&rsquo;clock. She would leave for her
      lessons in half an hour. Luckily to-day my own engagements did not begin
      till ten. If I hurried, I should be in time to catch her. I put on my hat
      and walked at top-speed toward Fifty-first street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the door of the apartment-house, my worry subsided as abruptly
      and with as little provocation as it had sprung up. Indeed, I laughed as I
      remembered it. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;nothing is the matter. Still I am not
      sorry to have come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Miss Pathzuol gone out yet?&rdquo; I asked the janitress who let me in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not seen her,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But she may have done so without my
      noticing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I ran up the stairs and rang Veronika&rsquo;s bell.&mdash;No response.&mdash;I
      rang again.&mdash;Again no response.&mdash;A third ring, with waning hope
      of success: and, &ldquo;So,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;I am too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Disappointed, I was retracing my steps down the staircase. I stood aside
      to let some one pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, how do you do?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Tikulski. &ldquo;What brings you out so
      early?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but come back with me and have a cup of coffee. I
      have been out all night, struggling with an obstinate little aria. I will
      play it for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He unlocked the door. The parlor was dark. The shades had not yet been
      drawn. As he sent them flying up with a screech, my heart sank. Every
      thing was just as we had left it last night; but it was cheerless and
      empty with her away. There lay the Chopin still open on the music rest.
      There were our two chairs still close together as we had placed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tikulski went after the coffee apparatus; presently returned, arranged it
      on the table, and applied a match to the lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While we wait for the water to boil,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will give you the
      result of my night&rsquo;s labor. I composed it walking up and down under the
      trees in the park, so that they&mdash;the trees&mdash;might claim it for
      their fruit! Ha-ha! A heavenly night: the sky could scarcely hold the
      stars, there were so many; but terribly warm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he went away&mdash;to fetch his instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was gone a long while. The water began to boil&mdash;boiled loudly and
      more loudly. A dense stream of vapor gushed from the nozzle of the pot.
      Still he remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I lost patience. Stepping to the threshold, I called his name. At
      first he did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Tikulski!&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I seemed to hear&mdash;no, certainly did hear&mdash;his voice, low,
      inarticulate, down at the other end of the hallway. It alarmed me. Had he
      met with an accident? hurt himself? fainted after the night&rsquo;s vigil?
      paralysis? apoplexy? I hastened toward him, entered the room whence his
      voice had sounded. There he stood. He stood in the center of the floor,
      immobile as a statue, his face livid, his attitude that of a man who has
      seen a ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, what has happened?&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He appeared not to hear. I repeated my question.
    </p>
    <p>
      He roused himself. A tremor swept over him. A painful rattling was audible
      in his throat. He raised his arm heavily and pointed. &ldquo;L-look,&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked. How can I tell what I saw?

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>ND yet I must tell
      it, though the telling consume me like a flame. I saw a bed and Veronika
      lying on it, face downward. She was dressed in her customary black gown. I
      supposed she was asleep. I supposed she was asleep, for one short moment.
      That was the last moment of my life. For then the truth burst upon me,
      fell upon me like a shaft from out the skies and hurled me into hell. I
      saw&mdash;not that she was dead only. If she had only died it would be
      different. I saw&mdash;merciful God!&mdash;I saw that she was murdered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, of course I would not, could not, believe it. Of course it was a
      dream, a nightmare, an hallucination, from which I should presently awake.
      Of course the thing was impossible, could not be. Of course I flung myself
      upon the bed at her side and crushed her between my arms and covered her
      with kisses and called and cried to her to move, to speak, to come back to
      life. And although her hands were icy cold and her body rigid and her face
      as white as marble, and although&mdash;ah, no! I may leave out the
      horrible detail&mdash;still I could not believe. I could not believe&mdash;yet
      how could I deny? There she lay, my sweetheart, my promised bride, deaf to
      my voice, blind to my presence, unmoved by my despair, beyond the reach of
      my strongest love, never to care for me again&mdash;Veronika, my tender,
      sad Veronika&mdash;oh, she lay there, dead, murdered! And still, with the
      knife-hilt staring at me like the face of Satan, still I could not
      believe. It was the fact, the unalterable fact, the fact that extinguished
      the light of the sun and stars and flooded the universe with blackness:
      and still, in spite of it, I called to her and crushed her in my embrace
      and kissed her and caressed her and was sure it could not be true. And
      meantime people came and filled the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not see the people. Only in a vague way I knew that they were there,
      heard the murmur of their voices, as if they were a long distance off. I
      had no senses left. I could neither see nor hear distinctly. My eyes were
      burned by a fierce red fire. My ears were full of the uproar of a thousand
      devils. But I knew that people had intruded upon us. I knew that I hated
      them because they would not leave us two alone. I remember I rose and
      faced them and cursed them and told them to be gone. And then I took her
      in my arms again and pressed her hard to me and forgot every thing but
      that she would not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually, however, nature was coming to my rescue. Gradually I seemed to
      be sinking into a stupor&mdash;had no sensation left except a numb,
      bruised feeling from head to foot&mdash;forgot what the matter was, forgot
      even Veronika, simply existed in a state of half conscious wretchedness.
      The first frenzy of grief had spent itself. The very immensity of the pain
      I had suffered acted as an opiate, exhausted and rendered me insensible. I
      heard the voices of the people as a soldier who is wounded may still hear
      something of the din of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know how long I had lain thus when I became aware that a hand was
      placed upon my shoulder. Some one shook me roughly and said, &ldquo;Get up and
      come away.&rdquo; Passively, I obeyed. &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said the same person, pushing
      me into a chair. I sat down and relapsed into my stupor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I don&rsquo;t know how long it was before they disturbed me for a second
      time. Two or three men were standing in front of me. One of them was in
      uniform. Slowly I recognized that he was an officer, a captain of police.
      He spoke. I heard what he said without understanding, as one who is half
      asleep hears what is said at his bedside. This much only I gathered, that
      he wanted me to go with him somewhere. I was too much dazed to care what I
      did or what was done with me. He took my arm and led me away. He led me
      into the street. There was a a great crowd. I shut my eyes and tottered
      along at his side. We entered a house. Somebody asked me a lot of
      questions&mdash;my name and where I lived and so forth&mdash;to which my
      lips framed mechanical answers. I can remember nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      When consciousness revived I was made to understand that I had fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where am I? What has happened?&rdquo; I asked, trying to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      The police-captain explained. &ldquo;Mr. Neuman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have made all the
      inquiry that is as yet possible, and the result is that I deem it my duty
      to take you in custody. I prefer no charge, but I believe I am bound to
      hold you for the inquest. The hour of your leaving her last night, the
      time that Miss Pathzuol has apparently been dead, and the fact that you
      were the last person known to have been in her company, make it incumbent
      upon me to place you under arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I pondered his words. Every thing came back. I was accused, or at least
      suspected, of having murdered Veronika&mdash;<i>I!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt no emotion. I was stunned as yet, like a man who has received a
      blow between the eyes. My brain had turned to stone. I repeated over to
      myself all that the captain had said. The words wrought no effect. I did
      not even experience pain as I thought of her. She is dead? I queried. They
      were three vapid syllables. My senses I had recovered&mdash;I could see
      and hear plainly now&mdash;could remember the events of the morning in
      detail and in their correct order. But somehow I had lost all capacity for
      feeling.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>ND so it continued
      throughout the inquest and throughout the trial&mdash;for, yes, they tried
      me for my sweetheart&rsquo;s murder. I ate, drank, slept, and answered the
      questions that were put to me, all in a dazed, dull way, but suffered no
      pain, no surprise, no indignation, had no more sensation than a dead man.
      That Veronika had been killed, and that I was accused of having killed
      her, were the facts which I heard told and told again from morning till
      night each day; yet I had not the least conception of what they signified.
      I was too stunned and benumbed to realize.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first day passed by, and the second and the third, every one of them
      busy with events that meant life or death for me: yet I took no notice.
      When left to myself, invariably I closed my eyes, and the stupor settled
      over my senses like a cloud of smoke. When aroused, I did whatever was
      required as passively as an automaton. I remember those first few days as
      one remembers a hateful dream. I remember being driven in a dark, noisy
      vehicle from the station-house to the city prison, and having in the
      latter place a cell assigned to me which was destined to serve as my home
      for many weeks. I remember making several trips, handcuffed to my
      custodian, from the jail to the office where the inquest was held and
      back: but my only recollection of the inquest itself is a confused one&mdash;a
      crowded, foul-smelling room, a chaos of faces and voices, endless talking,
      endless questioning of myself by men who were strangers to me. I remember
      that by and by these journeys came to an end: but what the verdict of the
      inquest was I do not remember&mdash;I do not think I troubled myself to
      ask at the time. Then I remember that after some days spent alone in my
      cell one of the keepers said, &ldquo;You are indicted,&rdquo; and inquired whether I
      wished to communicate with my attorney. Indicted? My attorney? I did not
      comprehend. I do not remember what I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the door of my cell opened, and they brought in a trunk and a
      violin-case and placed them on the floor at the foot of my cot.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recognized these for my own property. Mechanically I took out my violin
      and drew forth one long, clear note. That note was like a sudden flash of
      light. For a single instant the desolation to which my world had been
      reduced became visible in all its ghastliness. For a single instant I
      realized my position, realized that Veronika was dead, and the rest. The
      truth pierced my consciousness like an arrow and made my body quake with
      pain. But immediately the darkness settled over me again, the stupor
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, however, this stupor was changing its character. By degrees, so
      far as my mere thinking faculties were involved, it began to be
      dissipated. By degrees my mind struggled out of it. I began to notice and
      to understand things, and was able to converse and to appreciate what was
      said. But over my feelings it retained its sway. Although I was quite
      competent now to follow the explanations of my lawyer&mdash;how Veronika
      had been murdered and how and why I was suspected as the murderer&mdash;still
      I had no feeling of any sort about the matter. I might have been a log of
      wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      My lawyer had presented himself one day and volunteered his services. I
      had accepted them without even inquiring his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at his face but could not recall having seen it before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Epstein,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We went to school together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I remember,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regularly each day he came and reported the progress of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are building up a strong case against you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our only hope
      lies in an alibi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; I inquired dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      He explained; and continued, &ldquo;Of course the prosecution won&rsquo;t tell me what
      tack they mean to pursue, but from several little things that have leaked
      out I infer that they have a pretty strong case. Now, at what hour did you
      leave Miss Pathzuol that night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At about midnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And went directly home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Directly home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After entering your house did you meet any of the other occupants? any of
      your fellow-lodgers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must make an effort to remember. Try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, I don&rsquo;t remember,&rdquo; I repeated. His persistence irritated me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You appear to take as little interest in this case as though it were the
      life of a dog hanging in the scales instead of your own,&rdquo; he said, and
      that was the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day his face wore a somber expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is too bad,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I have interviewed your landlady and your
      fellow-lodgers, and not one of them can swear to your alibi. I know you
      are innocent, but I don t see how I am to prove it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last the trial began.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat through that trial, the most indifferent person in the court-room. I
      heard the testimony of the witnesses and the speeches of the lawyers
      simply because I was close at hand and could not help it. But I was the
      least interested of the many auditors, the least curious as to the result.
      Yet, stolid, indifferent, inattentive as I was, every detail of the trial
      is stamped upon my memory in indelible hues. Here is the story of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first day was used in securing a jury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second day commenced with an address&mdash;an &ldquo;opening&rdquo; they called it&mdash;by
      the counsel for the prosecution. He told quietly who Veronika was, how she
      had lived alone with her uncle, and how on the morning of the 13th July
      they had found her, murdered. He said that a remarkable train of
      circumstantial evidence pointed to one man as the murderer. Then he raised
      his voice and dwelt upon the blackness of that man&rsquo;s soul. Then he faced
      around and bade the prisoner stand up. Shaking his finger at me,
      &ldquo;Gentlemen of the jury,&rdquo; he thundered, &ldquo;there is the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first witness was Tikulski. He testified to the discovery of the
      murder in the manner already known; told how he had been absent all night
      that night; and explained the nature of the relations that subsisted
      between Veronika and myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you got home on the morning of the 13th in what condition was the
      door of your apartment?&rdquo; asked the district-attorney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In its usual condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say, locked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had not been broken open or tampered with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so far as I could see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On cross-examination he said that he had never heard a harsh word pass
      between Veronika and myself, that on the contrary I had given him every
      reason for considering me a most tender and devoted lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when made aware of the death of his betrothed,&rdquo; pursued my lawyer,
      &ldquo;how did Mr. Neuman conduct himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He acted like a crazy man&mdash;like one paralyzed by a tremendous blow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go, Mr. Tikulski,&rdquo; said my lawyer. &ldquo;But I wish to say,&rdquo; began
      Tikulski, &ldquo;that I do not believe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; cried the prosecutor. &ldquo;Your honor, I object to any expression of
      opinion by the witness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter about what you don&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; said the Judge to Tikulski.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must hold your tongue,&rdquo; imperiously. &ldquo;You can go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man left the stand and elbowed his way to my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I wished to say was,&rdquo; he whispered into my ear, &ldquo;that I believe you
      are as innocent as I myself. It is outrageous, this trial. They compelled
      me to testify. But you must understand that I am sure of your innocence. I
      don&rsquo;t know why they hushed me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the captain of police had succeeded him, and sworn to having
      visited the scene of the crime and to having placed the prisoner under
      arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said the district-attorney, &ldquo;here is a key. Have you seen it
      before?&rdquo; handing a key to the witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us when and where.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took it from the prisoner on the morning of his arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What further can you say about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Subsequently it was identified as a key to the apartments occupied by the
      deceased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you try it yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did. It fitted the lock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; Epstein asked me. &ldquo;How did you come by that key?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember ever having had it
      in my possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is an ugly circumstance, and must be accounted for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what difference does it make?&rdquo; I retorted petulantly. &ldquo;Leave me
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few little trifles like this may make the difference of your neck,&rdquo;
       muttered Epstein, and he looked disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; continued the district-attorney, &ldquo;just one thing more. Do you
      recognize this handkerchief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it was found in the pocket of the prisoner when he was searched at
      the station-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My lawyer got hold of the handkerchief and exhibited it to me. It was
      stained dull brown. &ldquo;This is blood,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I haven&rsquo;t an idea,&rdquo; was the utmost I could respond. Epstein
      looked more uneasy than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Captain,&rdquo; said the prosecutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But before you leave the stand,&rdquo; put in Epstein, &ldquo;kindly tell us what the
      prisoner&rsquo;s conduct was from the time you took charge of the premises down
      to the time you locked him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first he acted as though he was crazy; raved and carried on like a
      madman. Afterward he became quiet and sort of dull. At the station-house
      he fainted away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t act as though he liked it&mdash;as though the death of Miss
      Pathzuol was a thing that pleased him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; on the contrary. He acted as though it had been a great shock to
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next came a physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he was a police-surgeon. At about nine o&rsquo;clock on the morning of
      July 13th he had been summoned to the house of the decedent; had examined
      the body and satisfied himself as to the mode of death. There were three
      separate knife-wounds. These he proceeded to describe in technical
      language. Not one of them could have been self-inflicted; any one of them
      was sufficient to have caused immediate death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Merrill,&rdquo; inquired the prosecutor, &ldquo;how long&mdash;how many hours&mdash;prior
      to your arrival must the crime have been perpetrated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From seven to ten hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that the crime must have been perpetrated between eleven and two
      o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good.&mdash;Now, Doctor, here is a handkerchief which the captain says he
      took from the prisoner on the morning of his arrest. Do you recognize it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on&mdash;what about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was submitted to me for chemical analysis&mdash;to analyze the
      substance, with which it is discolored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you found?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found that it was stained with blood,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Human blood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About how long had it been shed? Did its condition indicate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From its condition when submitted to me&mdash;that is, at about noon on
      the 13th&mdash;I inferred that it had been shed not much less nor much
      more than twelve hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Doctor,&rdquo; said the lawyer. To Epstein, &ldquo;Your witness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Doctor,&rdquo; said Epstein. Turning to me, &ldquo;You can give no
      explanation of this circumstance?&rdquo; he whispered.&mdash;&ldquo;None,&rdquo; I answered.&mdash;To
      the witness, &ldquo;Doctor, blood may be shed in divers ways, may it not? This
      blood on the handkerchief, for instance&mdash;it might have come from&mdash;say,
      a nose-bleed, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon smiled, hesitated, then replied, &ldquo;Possibly, though not
      probably. Its quality is rather that of blood from a wound than that of
      blood from congested capillaries. But it is quite possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go, Doctor.&rdquo;&mdash;To me, &ldquo;Are you sure you didn&rsquo;t have a
      nose-bleed on the night in question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing at all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next witness was a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said she was the janitress of the apartment-house, No.&mdash;East
      Fifty-first street. It was a portion of her duty as such to open the
      street-door when the bell was rung. On the evening of July 12th, she had
      opened the door and admitted the prisoner between seven and eight o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you say at what hour the prisoner left the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I can. It was a warm night, and me and my husband were seated
      out on the stoop for the sake of the breeze till late. Mr. Neuman went out
      a little before twelve o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He entered between seven and eight. He left at about midnight. Now,
      meanwhile, whom else did you admit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one at all. From half past seven until midnight no one went in except
      Mr. Neuman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was not that a somewhat unusual circumstance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most extraordinary. Me and my husband spoke about it at the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can swear positively on this score?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, because we staid on the stoop the whole evening and not a soul could
      have passed us without our seeing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there any other means of ingress to the house of which you have
      charge than the street door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; the basement-door and the scuttle-door in the roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was their condition on the night of the 12th of July?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were locked and bolted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was their condition on the morning of the 13th?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At six o&rsquo;clock when I opened the house they were still locked and
      bolted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meantime could they have been unlocked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, because I carried the keys in my pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what are the means of ingress to the flat occupied by Mr. Tikulski?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The door that opens from his private hall into the outer hall of the
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, your honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you recognize this key?&rdquo; handing to the witness the key that the
      officer had identified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a key to Mr. Tikulski&rsquo;s door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here befell a pause, during which the jurymen shifted in their seats and
      the prosecutor consulted with his colleague. In a moment he resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mrs. Marshall, you have testified that the prisoner at the bar,
      Ernest Neuman, left the house, No.&mdash;East Fifty-first street, shortly
      before midnight on the 12th of July. Your memory on this point is entirely
      trustworthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Did you notice his movements after that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us what they were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, he crossed over the street and stood on the sidewalk under a
      lamp-post looking up at the front of the house toward Mr. Tikulski&rsquo;s
      windows, and then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For how long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t tell exactly, but maybe for the time it would take you to walk
      around the block.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For five minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, or more likely for ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and then, as I was saying, he marched straight away toward the
      avenue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toward what avenue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toward Second avenue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And disappeared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And disappeared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see any thing more of him that night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When and under what circumstances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In about a quarter of an hour, your honor, Mr. Neuman he comes back and
      stands leaning up against the railing across the way; and pretty soon
      crosses over and goes past us without speaking a word and enters the
      house, the door being open, and goes up the stairs.&rdquo; My lawyer turned
      sharply to me. &ldquo;Is this true?&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;No, it is entirely false,&rdquo; I
      answered. But I did not care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; resumed the district-attorney, &ldquo;was at about what hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, you can reckon it for yourself, sir. It was a little after twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Now, at what hour did you shut up the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was after one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had the prisoner meantime gone out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that consecutively from the moment of his reëntrance to the hour of
      your closing up, he was in the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile, who else had entered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two of the tenants, Mr. and Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, the tenants
      of the first flat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, Mrs. Marshall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My lawyer cross-questioned her for an hour. His utmost art was powerless
      to shake her. She reiterated absolutely and word for word what she had
      already sworn to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Marshall!&rdquo; called the prosecutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the husband of the janitress. He confirmed her story, and like her,
      was impregnable to Epstein&rsquo;s assaults.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s our case, your honor,&rdquo; said the district-attorney to the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we will adjourn until to-morrow,&rdquo; replied the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was handcuffed and led back to the Tombs, a crowd following. Epstein
      joined me in my cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about that key?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the blood on your handkerchief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember. Perhaps, as you suggested, I had a nose-bleed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure you did not reenter the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am sure of that. I went straight home and to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the Marshalls have lied out and out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take the stand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to defend, to exonerate yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feared as much. My friend, your life depends upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I care for my life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your good name&mdash;you cherish your good name, do you not?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He attempted to plead, to reason with me. &ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; I insisted. He
      went his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honor,&rdquo; he said next day in court, &ldquo;I ask that the jury be directed
      to render a verdict of not guilty, on the ground that the prosecution has
      failed to show any motive on the part of my client for the crime of which
      he is accused. Where the evidence is wholly circumstantial, as in the
      present case, a failure to show motive is fatal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not hamper the jury,&rdquo; said the judge. &ldquo;They must decide the case
      on its merits.&rdquo; Epstein called, &ldquo;Mrs. Burrows.&rdquo; My landlady took the
      witness-chair and testified to my excellent character. He called a handful
      more to testify to the same thing; then said, &ldquo;I am ready to sum up, your
      honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so,&rdquo; replied the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Epstein spoke shortly and quietly. I remember his argument word for word;
      yet I was not conscious of attending to it at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said, &ldquo;We are not prepared to contest the matters of fact alleged by
      the prosecution, nor to deny that their bearing is against my client. That
      Mr. Neuman was in Miss Pathzuol&rsquo;s company on the night of July 12th, and
      that the next morning a blood-stained handkerchief and a key to Mr.
      Tikulski&rsquo;s door were taken from his pocket, we admit. We will even admit
      that these circumstances are of a sort to cast suspicion upon him: all
      that we claim is that they are not sufficient to confirm that suspicion
      and make it certainty. It is the liberty, perhaps the life, of a human
      being which you have at your disposal. No matter how dark the shadow over
      him may be, if you can entertain a reasonable doubt of his guilt, you must
      acquit. And, putting it to you in all simplicity and sincerity, I ask:
      Does not the evidence offered by the prosecution leave room for a
      reasonable doubt? Is it not possible that some other hand than Neuman&rsquo;s
      dealt the blows by which Veronika Pathzuol met her death? If such a
      possibility exists, you must give Neuman the benefit of it; you must
      acquit. Consider his good character; consider that he was the betrothed of
      the lady whose murderer they would make him out to be; consider that
      absolutely no trace of motive has been brought home to him; consider that
      on the contrary he was the one man who above all others most desired that
      she might live; consider these matters, and then decide whether in
      reasonableness his guilt is not in doubt. Remember that it is not
      sufficient that there should be a presumption against him. Remember that
      there must be proof. Remember also what a grave duty yours is, and how
      grave the consequences, should you send an innocent man to the gallows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one word more. I had naturally intended to place my client upon the
      stand, and let him justify himself by his own word of mouth. But,
      unfortunately, I am not able to do so, because morally and physically he
      is prostrated and unfitted for sustaining the strain of an examination.
      But after all, if you will for a moment imagine yourselves in Mr. Neuman&rsquo;s
      position, you can conceive that his defense must necessarily be of a
      passive, not of an active, kind. In his position what could you say? Why,
      only that you were ignorant of the whole transaction, and innocent despite
      appearances, and as much at loss for a solution of the mystery involving
      it as his honor himself. This is what Neuman would say were he able to go
      upon the stand. But one thing more he would say. He would impugn the
      veracity of the Marshalls. He would maintain that they lied <i>in toto</i>
      when they swore to his second entrance. He would tell you that when he
      left the house in Fifty-first street at midnight, he went directly home
      and to his bed, and that he returned no more until the next morning. And
      he would leave you to choose between his story and that of Mr. and Mrs.
      Marshall. My opponent will ask, &lsquo;Why not prove an alibi, then?&rsquo; Because,
      when Mr. Neuman returned to his lodging-house late that night, every body,
      as might have been expected, was asleep. He encountered no one in the hall
      or on the stairs. He mounted straight to his own bed-chamber and went to
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust the matter to your discretion. I am sure that you will weigh it
      carefully and conscientiously. You will realize that the life of a fellow
      man hangs upon your verdict, and you will deliberate well, if there be
      not, on the whole, a reasonable doubt in his favor. You will, I am
      confident, in no uncertain mind consign Ernest Neuman to the grave of a
      felon.&rdquo; The district-attorney&rsquo;s address was florid and rhetorical. It
      lasted about two hours. He resumed the evidence. He said that an ordinary
      process of elimination would suffice to fasten the guilt upon the prisoner
      at the bar. The gist of his argument was that as Neuman had been the only
      person in the victim&rsquo;s company at the time of the commission of the crime,
      he was consequently the only person who by a physical possibility could be
      guilty. He warned the jury against allowing their sympathies to interfere
      with their judgment, and read at length from a law book respecting the
      value of circumstantial proof. He ridiculed Epstein&rsquo;s impeachment of the
      Marshalls, and added that even without their testimony the doctor&rsquo;s story
      and the police-captain&rsquo;s story, coupled with my own &ldquo;eloquent silence,&rdquo;
       were conclusive. It was the obvious duty of the jury to convict.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge delivered his charge, dealing with the legal aspect of the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Epstein rose again. &ldquo;I request your honor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to charge that in
      the event of the jurymen finding that there is a reasonable doubt in
      Neuman&rsquo;s favor, they must acquit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I so charge,&rdquo; assented the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I request your honor,&rdquo; Epstein continued, &ldquo;to charge that if the jurymen
      consider the fact of no motive having been shown, sufficient to establish
      a reasonable doubt of the defendant&rsquo;s guilt, they must acquit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I so charge you, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jurymen filed out of the room. The judge left the bench. It was now
      about four in the afternoon. Half an hour passed. The court-room began to
      empty. Another half hour passed. Only the court attendants, Epstein, the
      district-attorney&rsquo;s colleague, and the prisoner remained. One of the
      attendants held a whispered conference with Epstein: then said to me,
      &ldquo;There is no prospect of a speedy agreement. Come.&rdquo; I rose, followed him
      to the rear of the room, and was locked up in the prisoner&rsquo;s pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It got dark. I sat still in the dark and waited. The stupor bound my
      faculties like a frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been dark many hours when the door of the pen swung open. The same
      attendant again said, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The court-room was lighted by a few feeble gas jets. The judge sat on the
      bench. The district-attorney was laughing and chatting with him. Epstein
      said, &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, summon all your strength. They have agreed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The jurymen entered in single file, took their places, settled themselves
      in their chairs. The judge and the prosecutor suspended their
      pleasantries. The clerk cleared his throat. There was a second of dead
      silence. Then, &ldquo;Prisoner, stand up,&rdquo; called the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prisoner, look you upon the jury. Jury, look you upon the prisoner,&rdquo; the
      clerk cried, machine-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the murky light of the gas I could have gathered nothing from the faces
      of the jurymen, even had I been concerned to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon a verdict?&rdquo; the metallic
      voice of the clerk rang out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreman rose. &ldquo;We have,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How say you, do you find the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty of
      the offense for which he stands indicted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not guilty,&rdquo; said the foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Epstein grasped my hand and crunched it hard. His own was clammy. He did
      not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen of the jury, you say you find the prisoner at the bar not
      guilty of homicide in the first degree, and so your verdict stands
      recorded. Neuman, you are discharged.&rdquo; It was the clerk&rsquo;s last word.
    </p>
    <p>
      I quitted the court-room, a free man. I was as indifferent to my freedom
      as I had been to my peril. There was no consciousness of relief in my
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Epstein stood at my elbow. &ldquo;You must be weak and faint,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led me through the silent streets and into a restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is an all-night place,&rdquo; he said, with an attempt at cheerfulness,
      &ldquo;and much frequented by journalists. What will you have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not hungry,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you must take something,&rdquo; he urged with a touch of ruefulness,
      &ldquo;just a bite to celebrate our victory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I drank a cup of coffee. When we were again out-doors, Epstein cried,
      &ldquo;Why, see; it is beginning to get light. Morning already.&rdquo; A fresh wind
      blew in our faces, and the blackness of the sky was giving place to gray.
      &ldquo;I must leave you now,&rdquo; said Epstein, &ldquo;and hurry home. Where will you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stroll about for a while. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;

      VI.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> WALKED along
      aimlessly, recounting all the happenings of the last few weeks. I was
      astonished at my own blank insensibility. &ldquo;Why, Veronika, the Veronika you
      loved, is dead, murdered,&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;and you, you who loved her,
      have been in prison and on trial for the crime. They have outraged you.
      They have sworn falsely against you. And the very core of your life has
      been torn out. Yet you&mdash;what has come over you? Are you heartless,
      have you no capacity for grief or indignation? Oris it that you are still
      half stunned? And that presently you will come to and begin to feel?&rdquo; I
      strode on and on. It was broad day now. By and by I looked around.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in Second avenue, near its southern extremity. I was standing in
      front of a large red brick house. A white placard nailed to the door
      caught my eye. &ldquo;Room to let,&rdquo; it said in big black letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Room to let?&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;Why, I am in need of a room.&rdquo; And I entered
      the house and engaged the room. The landlady asked my name. I told her it
      was Lexow, that having been the maiden-name of my mother. Neuman had
      acquired too unpleasant a notoriety through the published accounts of the
      trial. As Lexow I have been known ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      I employed an express agent to go to the Tombs and bring back my luggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I sat at my window and watched the people pass in the street. I sat
      there stockstill all day. I was aware of a vague feeling of wretchedness,
      of a vague craving for a relief which I could not name. As dusk gathered,
      a lump grew bigger and bigger in my throat. &ldquo;I am beginning to be
      unhappy,&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;It is high time.&rdquo; My insensibility had frightened as
      well as puzzled me. Instinctively, I knew it could not last forever, knew
      it for the calm that precedes the storm. I was anxious that the storm
      should break while I was still strong enough to cope with its fury.
      Waiting weakened me. Besides, I was ashamed of myself, hated myself as one
      shallow and disloyal. That I could be indifferent to Veronika&rsquo;s death! I,
      who had called myself her lover!
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, as the lump grew in my throat, now, I thought, perhaps the hour
      has come. I sat still in my chair, fanning this forlorn spark of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, by imperceptible degrees, sleep stole upon me. It was natural.
      I had been up for more than six-and-thirty hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I awoke a singular thing happened. Memory played me a singular trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      I awoke, conscious of a great luminous joy in my heart. It was full
      morning. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;how bright the sunshine is! how sweet the air!
      To-day I will go to Veronika to-day, after my lessons&mdash;and spend the
      lest of the afternoon and the evening at her side!&rdquo; My heart leaped at
      this prospect of happiness in store: and I commenced to plan the afternoon
      and evening in detail. At last I jumped up, eager to begin the delicious
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trick that memory played me was a simple one, after all. The recent
      past had simply for the moment been obliterated, and I transported back
      for a moment into the old time. As I stood now in the middle of the floor,
      my eye was struck by the strangeness of my surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how is this?&rdquo; I questioned. &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a trice I was bewildered, but only for a trice. The truth reasserted
      itself all at once&mdash;rose up and faced me with its grim, deathly
      visage, as if cleared by a stroke of lightning. All at once I remembered;
      and what is more, all at once the stupor that had hung like a cloud
      between me and the facts, rolled away. I looked at my world. It was dust
      and ashes, a waste space, peopled by ghosts. My heart recoiled, sickened,
      horrified; then began to throb with the pain that had been ripening in its
      womb ever since the morning when Tikulski pointed to her, stretched
      murdered upon the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, at last the storm had broken; at last I realized. At last I could no
      longer reproach myself for a want of sensibility. At last I had my desire.
      I yielded myself to the enjoyment of it for the remainder of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      For weeks afterward I lay at the point of death. The slow convalescence
      that ensued afforded me plenty of time to examine my position from every
      point of view, and to get accustomed to understanding that the light had
      gone out of my sky. Of course I hated the fate that condemned me to regain
      my health. The thought that I should have to drag out years and years of
      blank, aimless, joyless life, appalled me. The future was a night through
      which I should be compelled to toil with no hope of morning. Strangely
      enough, the idea of suicide never once suggested itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was able to go out, I repaired to Epstein&rsquo;s office. Several little
      matters remained to be settled with him. As I was about to leave, he said,
      &ldquo;Neuman, do you propose to take any steps toward finding the murderer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toward finding the murderer? Why, no; I had not thought of doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But of course you will. You won&rsquo;t allow the affair to rest in <i>statu
      quo?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, considering your relations to Miss Pathzuol, I should think your
      motive would be plain. Don&rsquo;t you want to see her murderer punished, her
      death atoned for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her death atoned for! Her death can never be atoned for. And the
      punishment of her murderer&mdash;would that restore her to me? Would that
      undo the fact that she is dead? Else, why should I bestir myself about
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Common human nature ought to be enough; the natural wish to square
      accounts with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you fancy, Epstein, that such an account as this can be squared?
      Suppose we had him here now at our mercy, what could we do by way of
      squaring accounts? Put him to death? Would that square the account? To say
      so would be to compare his miserable life to hers.&mdash;But besides, he
      is not at our mercy. We have no clew to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, on the contrary, we have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the most apparent one. You are sure the Marshalls lied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; I am sure of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what earthly inducement could they have had for lying&mdash;for
      perjuring themselves, mind you, and running the risk of being caught and
      sent to prison&mdash;what earthly inducement, unless thereby they hoped to
      cover up their own guilt by throwing suspicion upon another man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that is so. I had not thought of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, if you and I are sure that the Marshalls participated in that
      crime, there is a solid starting-point. Now, will you not join me and help
      to fasten the guilt upon them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good would it do? I say again, would that give her back to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear fellow, even if you have no desire to see the murderer
      punished, you must at least wish to retaliate upon the wretches who
      jeopardized your life by their false swearing, who sought to thrust upon
      your innocent shoulders the brunt of their own offending.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I confess, I have no such wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but you amaze me. Have you not the ordinary instincts of a man?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the business of the police, any how. Let them move in the matter.
      You ought to understand that I am sick and tired, that all I wish for is
      to be left alone. No, no; if the Marshalls should ever be brought to
      justice it will not be by my efforts. The police can manage it for
      themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is just the point.&rdquo; Epstein hesitated; at length went on,
      &ldquo;There is just the point I wanted to bring to your notice. It will be hard
      for you to hear, but you ought to understand&mdash;it is only right that I
      should tell you&mdash;that&mdash;that&mdash;why, hang it, the police will
      remain idle because they suppose they have already finished the business,
      already put their finger on the&mdash;the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why should they remain idle on that account? Why don&rsquo;t they arrest
      him and try him, as they did me, before a jury?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t comprehend, Neuman. The fact of the matter is&mdash;you must
      pardon me for saying so&mdash;the fact is, they still suspect you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suspect me? What, after the very jury has acquitted me? I thought the
      verdict of the jury was conclusive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is, in one sense. They can&rsquo;t put you in jeopardy again. But this is
      the way they stand. They say, &lsquo;We haven&rsquo;t sufficient legal evidence to
      warrant a conviction, but we feel morally certain, all the same, and so
      there&rsquo;s no use prying further.&rsquo; That is my reason for broaching the
      subject and for urging you so strongly. You ought to clear your character,
      vindicate your innocence, by proving to the police that they are wrong,
      that the guilt rests with their own witnesses, the Marshalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Epstein, for telling me this. I am glad to realize just what
      my status is. But let me cherish no misconception. Is this theory of the
      police&mdash;is it held by others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be frank, I am afraid it is. The newspapers took it up and&mdash;and
      I&rsquo;m afraid it s the opinion of the public generally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the verdict did not signify?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at least not so far as public opinion is concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that I am to rest under this stigma all my life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no&mdash;not if you choose to exonerate yourself, as I have
      indicated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t care about that. I don&rsquo;t care to exonerate myself. What
      difference would it make? Would it make the fact that she is lost to me
      forever one shade less true? Only, it is well that I should have a clear
      understanding of my position, and I thank you for giving it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that you are going to drop the case there?&rdquo; Epstein
      demanded. &ldquo;I assure you, I never should have opened my mouth about it, had
      I foreseen this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t reproach yourself. You have simply done your duty. It was my right
      to hear this from you.&mdash;Yes, of course I shall drop the case.
      Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will think better of it; you will reconsider it; you will come back
      to-morrow in a wiser frame of mind. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I reentered my lodging-house the landlady met me; thrust an envelope
      into my hand; and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was surprised to see that the envelope was addressed to &ldquo;E. Neuman,
      Esquire.&rdquo; It will be remembered that I had introduced myself as Mr. Lexow.
      I tore it open. It inclosed a memorandum of my arrears of rent and a
      notice to quit, the latter couched thus: &ldquo;Mr. Neuman&rsquo;s real name having
      been learned during his sickness, please move out as soon as you have paid
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I caught sight of myself in the glass. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you are the person
      whom people suspect as a murderer! and it is thus that you are to be
      regarded all the rest of your life as one touched with the plague.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I counted my ready money and paid the landlady her due.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;but the reputation of my house&mdash;but
      the other lodgers&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t apologize,&rdquo; I interposed, and left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to me that it would be necessary to find work whereby to earn
      my livelihood. I had quite forgotten that I was poor. What should I do?
    </p>
    <p>
      The notion of giving music lessons again I could not entertain. Music had
      become hateful to me. I could not touch my violin. I could not even unlock
      the case and look at the instrument. It was too closely associated with
      the cause of my sorrow. The mere memory of a strain of music, drifting
      through my mind, was enough to cut my heart like a knife. Music was out of
      the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had had a little money in the Savings Bank. With this sum I had intended
      to furnish the rooms which she and I were to have occupied! Now it was all
      spent; three-quarters swallowed up by the expenses of my trial, the
      residue by the expenses of my illness and the landlady&rsquo;s score for rent. I
      opened my purse. I had less than a dollar left. So it behooved me to lose
      no time. I must find a means of support at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      But music apart, what remained?&mdash;My wits were sluggish. Revolving the
      problem over and over as I walked along, they could arrive at no solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were in December. The day was bitter cold. I had not proceeded a great
      distance before the cold began to tell upon me. &ldquo;I must step in somewhere
      and warm myself,&rdquo; I said. I was still feeble. I could not endure the
      stress of the weather as I might have done formerly. I made for the first
      shop I saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wine-shop, kept by a German, as the name above the door denoted.
      I took a table near the stove and asked for a glass of wine. As my senses
      thawed, I became aware that a quarrel was going on in the room&mdash;angry
      voices penetrated my hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor, a fat man in his shirt-sleeves, stood behind the bar. His
      face was very red! In his native tongue loudly and volubly he was berating
      one of his assistants&mdash;a waiter with a scared face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, go at once. You are a rascal, a good-for-naught,&rdquo; he was saying;
      &ldquo;here is your money. Clear out, before I hurt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The culprit was nervously untying his apron strings. &ldquo;Yes, sir, at once,
      at once,&rdquo; he stammered. In the end he put on his hat and accomplished a
      frightened exit. His <i>confreres</i> watched his decapitation with
      repressed sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had gone, the proprietor&rsquo;s wrath began perceptibly to mitigate.
      He settled down in his chair. The tint of his skin gradually cooled. He
      lighted a cigar. He picked up a newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had taken in these various proceedings mechanically, without bestowing
      upon them any special attention. But now an idea, prompted by them, began
      to fructify. By and by I approached the counter and ventured a timid, &ldquo;I
      beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor glanced up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; I continued in German, &ldquo;but you have discharged a
      waiter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you will probably need somebody to take his place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? What of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;that is, if you think I would do, I should like the
      employment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor looked thoughtful. He scratched his chin, puffed vigorously
      at his cigar, and asked my name. He shook his head when I confessed that I
      had had no experience of the business; but seemed impressed by my remark
      that on that account I would be willing to serve for smaller wages. He
      mentioned a stipend. It was ridiculously slender; but what cared I? It
      would keep body and soul together. I desired nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What references can you give?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mentioned Epstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can go to work at once. To-morrow I will look
      up your reference. If it be satisfactory, I will keep you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Oberkellner</i> provided me with an apron and a short alpaca
      jacket; and in this garb Ernest Neuman, musician, merged his identity, as
      he supposed for good and all, into that of Ernest Lexow, waiter.

      VII.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>WO years elapsed.
      Their history is easily told. I lived and moved and had my being in a
      profound apathy to all that passed around me. The material conditions of
      my existence caused me no distress. I dwelt in a dingy room in a dirty
      house; ate poor food, wore poor clothing, worked long hours; was treated
      as a menial and had to put up with a hundred indignities every day; but I
      was wholly indifferent, had other things to think of. My thoughts and my
      feelings were concentrated upon my one great grief. My heart had no room
      left in it for pettier troubles. I do not believe that there was a waking
      moment in those two years&rsquo; when I was unconscious of my love and my loss.
      Veronika abode with me morning, noon, and night. My memory of her and my
      unutterable sorrow for her engrossed me to the exclusion of all else.
    </p>
    <p>
      My violin I did not unlock from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end. I could not get
      over my hatred for the bare idea of music. Music recalled the past too
      vividly. I had not the fortitude to endure it. The sound of a hand-organ
      in the street was enough to cause me a twinge like that of a nerve touched
      by steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the winter leaped into spring, and days came which were the duplicates
      of those I had spent with her, of course my pain grew more acute. The
      murmur of out-door life and the warmth and perfume of the spring air,
      penetrated to the very quick of memory and made it quiver. But at about
      this time I began to taste an unexpected pleasure. It was an odd one. Of
      old, during our betrothal, I had been tormented almost nightly by bad
      dreams. As surely as I laid my head upon its pillow, so surely would I be
      wafted off into an ugly nightmare&mdash;she and I were separated&mdash;we
      had quarreled&mdash;she had ceased to love me. But now that my worst dream
      had been excelled by the reality, I began to have dreams of quite another
      sort. As soon as sleep closed upon me, the truth was annihilated, Veronika
      came back. All night long we were supremely happy; we played and sang and
      talked together, just as we had been used to do. These dreams were
      astonishingly life-like. Indeed, in the morning after one, I would wonder
      which was the very fact, the dream or the waking. My nightly dream got to
      be a goal to look forward to during the day. But as the summer deepened, I
      dreamed less and less frequently, and at length ceased altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Autumn returned, and winter; and my life did not vary. Time was slow about
      healing my wounds, if time meant to heal them at all. But time did not
      mean to heal them at all, as ere long became apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon in November, a month or so before the two years would have
      terminated, a young man entered the shop and ensconced himself at a table
      in the corner. Having delivered his order and lighted a cigarette, he
      pulled out a yellow covered French book from the pocket of his coat, and
      speedily became immersed in its perusal. I don&rsquo;t know what it was in the
      appearance of this young man that attracted my attention. Almost from the
      moment of his advent my eyes kept going back to him. His own eyes being
      fastened upon his book, I could stare at him without giving offense. And
      stare at him I did to my heart&rsquo;s content.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a tall young fellow and wore his hair a trifle longer than the
      fashion is. He was dressed rather carelessly; he knocked his cigarette
      ashes about so that they soiled his clothes. He had a dark skin, and, in
      singular contrast to it, a pair of large blue eyes. His forehead, nose,
      and chin were strongly modeled and expressed force of character without
      pretending to conventional beauty. He was not a handsome, but a
      distinguished looking man. The absence of beard and mustache lent him
      somewhat of the aspect of a Catholic priest. His big blue eyes were full
      of good-nature and intelligence. He had a quick, energetic way of moving
      which announced plenty of dash within. He had entered the shop like a gust
      of wind, had shot across the floor and taken his seat at the table as if
      impelled by the force of gunpowder, and now he turned the pages of his
      book with the air of a man whose life depended upon what he was doing. No
      sooner had he consumed one of his cigarettes than he applied a match to
      its successor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stared at him mercilessly and wondered what manner of individual he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not a business-man,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;nor a lawyer nor a doctor: that is
      evident from his whole bearing; and besides, what would he be doing in a
      wine-shop at this hour of the afternoon? I don&rsquo;t think he is a musician,
      either&mdash;he hasn&rsquo;t the musician&rsquo;s eyes or mouth. Possibly he is a
      school-teacher, or it may be&mdash;yes, I should say most certainly, he is
      an artist of some sort, a painter or sculptor, or perhaps a writer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My speculations had proceeded thus far when in the quick, energetic way
      above alluded to the young man looked at his watch, slammed to his book,
      shoved back his chair, and commenced hammering upon the table with the
      bottom of his empty beer-mug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; I said, responding to his summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Check,&rdquo; he demanded laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      I handed him his check. He thrust his fingers into his waistcoat-pocket
      for the money. They roamed about, apparently unrewarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A puzzled expression came upon his face. The fingers paused in their
      occupation; presently emerged and dived into another pocket and then into
      another. The puzzled expression deepened: at last changed its character,
      became an expression of intense annoyance. He knitted his brows and bit
      his lip. Glancing up, he said, &ldquo;This is really very awkward. I&mdash;I
      find I haven&rsquo;t a <i>sou</i> about me. It&rsquo;s&mdash;bother it all, I suppose
      you&rsquo;ll take me for a beat. But&mdash;here, I can leave my watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s entirely unnecessary,&rdquo; I hastened to put in. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it
      distress you. Tomorrow, or any other day you happen to be passing, will do
      as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the same time surprised and relieved. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a
      conservative way of doing business,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How do you know I may not
      take advantage of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m quite at rest about that. You need not be disturbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, such faith in human nature is stimulating,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I should
      hate to imperil it. So you may be sure I&rsquo;ll turn up to-morrow. Meanwhile
      I&rsquo;m awfully obliged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereat he went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I paid his reckoning from my own purse, and immediately fell again to
      wondering about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by it occurred to me, &ldquo;Why, that is the first human being who has
      taken you out of yourself for the last two years!&rdquo; And thereupon I
      transferred my wonder to the interest he had managed to arouse in my own
      preoccupied mind. Then gradually my thoughts flowed back into their
      customary channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      But early the next day I caught myself asking, &ldquo;Will he return?&rdquo; and
      devoutly hoping that he would. Not on account of the money; I had no
      anxiety about the money. But somehow, self-centered as I was, I had felt
      drawn toward this blue-eyed young man, and anticipated seeing him again
      with an approach to genuine pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely enough, in the course of the afternoon the door opened and he
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you see, I am faithful to my trust. Here is the lucre:
      count it and be satisfied that the sum is just. Really,&rdquo; he added,
      dropping the mock theatrical manner he had assumed, &ldquo;really, it was
      frightfully embarrassing yesterday. But I&rsquo;m a victim of absentmindedness,
      and in changing my clothes I had omitted to transfer my pocket-book from
      the one suit to the other. I can&rsquo;t tell you how much indebted I am for
      your considerateness. I suppose you are overrun with dead-beats who play
      that dodge regularly&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave him the answer his question called for, served him with the
      drinkables he ordered, and stationed, myself at a respectful distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lighted his inevitable cigarette and produced his book. He read and
      smoked for a few moments in silence. Suddenly he flung the book angrily
      upon the table, pushed back his glass, and uttered an audible &ldquo;Confound
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hastened forward to learn the subject of his discomposure and to supply
      what remedy I might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; I ventured, &ldquo;is there any thing wrong with the wine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh&mdash;what?&rdquo; he queried. &ldquo;With the wine? Any thing wrong? Oh&mdash;I
      perceive. Oh, no&mdash;the wine s all right. It&rsquo;s this beastly pedantic
      author. He is describing the Jewish ritual, and now just observe his
      idiocy. He goes on at a great rate about the beauty of a certain prayer&mdash;gets
      the reader&rsquo;s curiosity all screwed up&mdash;and then&mdash;fancy his airs!&mdash;and
      then quotes the stuff in the original Hebrew! It&rsquo;s ridiculous. He doesn&rsquo;t
      even condescend to affix a translation in a foot-note. Look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the book and pointed, with a finger dyed brown by tobacco-smoke,
      to the troublesome passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I, having been brought up as an orthodox Jew, had a smattering of
      Hebrew, and at a glance I saw that I could easily translate the few
      sentences in question. So, impulsively and without stopping to reflect
      that my conduct might seem officious, I said, &ldquo;If you would like, I think
      perhaps I may be able to aid you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed, fixing a pair of wide open eyes upon my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I can translate it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suspect you were a scholar. How in the
      name of goodness did you learn Hebrew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A scholar I am not, surely enough: but I am a Jew, and like the rest of
      my faith I studied Hebrew as a boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I understand. Well, fire away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took the book and read the Hebrew aloud. It was a prayer, which, when a
      child, I had known by heart. Afterward I explained its sense while my
      friend jotted it down with a pencil upon the margin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he was good enough to say. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I should have done
      without your help.&mdash;And so you are a Jew? You don&rsquo;t look it. You look
      like a full-blown Teuton. But I congratulate you all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Congratulate me for looking like a Teuton?&rdquo; The shop being empty, there
      was no harm in my joining in conversation with a client. Besides, I did
      not stop to think whether there was harm in it or not. I yielded to the
      attraction which this young man exerted over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;for belonging to the ancient and honorable race of Jews,&rdquo; he
      answered. &ldquo;Your ancestors were civilized and dwelt in cities and wrote
      poems, thousands of years ago: whereas mine at that epoch inhabited caves
      and dressed in bearskins and occasionally dined on a roasted neighbor. I
      should be proud of my lineage, were I a Jew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is the fashion for the Gentiles to despise us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bosh! It is the fashion for a certain ignorant, stupid set of
      Philistines to do so&mdash;but those who pretend to the least
      enlightenment, on the contrary, regard the Jews as a most enviable people.
      They envy your history, they envy the success that waits upon your
      enterprises. For my part, I believe the whole future of America depends
      upon the Jews.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, how is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, look here. What is the American people to-day? There is no American
      people&mdash;or rather there are twenty American peoples&mdash;the Irish,
      the German, the Jewish, the English, and the Negro elements&mdash;all
      existing independently at the same time, and each as truly American as any
      of the others. Good! But in the future, after emigration has ceased, these
      elements will begin to amalgamate. A single people of homogeneous blood
      will be the consequence. Do you follow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I follow. But the Jews?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Jews&mdash;precisely, the Jews. It is the Jewish element that is
      to leaven the whole lump&mdash;color the whole mixture. The English
      element alone is, so to speak, one portion of pure water; the German
      element, one portion of <i>eau sucrée</i>; now add the Jewish&mdash;it is
      a dose of rich strong wine. It will give fire and flavor to the decoction.
      The future Americans, thanks to the Jew in them, will have passions,
      enthusiasms. They will paint great pictures, compose great music, write
      great poems, be capable of great heroism. Have I said enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The result was that we chatted together for half an hour with the freedom
      of old acquaintances. He quite made me forget that I was his servant for
      the time, and led me to speak out my mind with the unreserve of equal to
      equal. I enjoyed a peculiar sense of exhilaration that lasted even after
      he had gone away. In spite of myself I could not help relishing this
      contact with a superior man. Again I fell to wondering about his
      occupation. I was more and more persuaded that he must be an artist of
      some sort, or a writer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day he came again, and the next, and the next, and regularly
      every day at about the same hour for a fortnight. As surely as he seated
      himself at the corner table, so surely would he beckon to me and begin to
      talk. In these dialogues he afforded me no end of entertainment, touching
      in a racy way upon a score of topics. He had resided abroad for some years&mdash;seemed
      equally at home in Paris, Rome, and Munich&mdash;and his anecdotes of
      foreign life were like glimpses into dream-land for me. He had the faculty
      of making me forget myself, and for that reason, if for no other, I should
      have valued his friendliness. Our interviews occurred as bright spots in
      the sad gray monotone of my daily life.

      VIII.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>UT one day, the
      fortnight having passed, he failed to put in an appearance. I was heartily
      disappointed. I spent the rest of the afternoon fathoms down in the blues&mdash;like
      an opium eater deprived of his daily portion. It was Saturday, and as
      usual at nightfall the shop filled up and the staff of waiters was kept
      busy. Toward ten o&rsquo;clock, long before which hour I had ceased altogether
      to expect him, the door opened and my friend came in. He squeezed up
      between a couple of Germans at one of the tables, and sat there smoking
      and reading an evening paper. I had no opportunity to do more than
      acknowledge the smile of greeting with which he favored me; and it chanced
      that the table at which he was established fell under the jurisdiction of
      another waiter. He consumed cigarette after cigarette and read his paper
      through to the very advertisements on the last page; and still, while the
      other guests came and went, he staid on. At the hour for shutting up he
      had not yet shown any disposition to depart. His attendant carried off his
      empty glass and hovered uneasily around his chair; but he failed to take
      the hint. At length the proprietor began to turn out the lights. At this
      he got up, buttoned his overcoat, waved a farewell at me, and passed
      beyond the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed soon after. Turning up Second avenue, I felt a hand laid gently
      upon my shoulder. &ldquo;I have been waiting for you,&rdquo; said my friend. &ldquo;Which
      way do you walk?&rdquo; Without pausing for a reply, &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t mind my walking
      with you?&rdquo; and he linked his arm in mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid I had seen the last of you for the day,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;This
      is a pleasant surprise, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a few yards in silence he resumed, &ldquo;I say&mdash;oh, by the way, you
      have never told me your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Lexow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Lexow?&mdash;Well, I say, Lexow, without being indiscreet, I should
      like to ask how under the sun you ever came to be employed as you are
      around in Herr Schwartz&rsquo;s saloon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh come now; yes, you do understand, too,&rdquo; he rejoined. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take
      offense and be dignified&mdash;We&rsquo;re both young men, and there&rsquo;s no use in
      trying to mystify each other. You needn&rsquo;t tell me that you have always
      been a waiter. You&rsquo;re too intelligent, too much of a gentleman in every
      way. I&rsquo;m not blind; and it doesn&rsquo;t require especially long spectacles to
      perceive that you are something different from what you would havens
      believe. I&rsquo;ve seen a good deal of the world and I&rsquo;m not prone to
      romancing. So I don&rsquo;t fancy that you&rsquo;re a king in exile or a Russian
      nobleman or any thing of that sort. But at the same time I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re
      capable of better things than waiting, and I want to know what the trouble
      is, so that I can help to set you back on the right track.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One confidence deserves another. I have told you my name, tell me yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Merivale, Daniel.&mdash;But don&rsquo;t change the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Merivale, I will say then, that if any other man had spoken to
      me as you have just done, I should certainly have been offended. I say
      this not to reproach you, but to show by the fact that I&rsquo;m not offended
      how much I think of you. So you mustn&rsquo;t take offense either when I add
      that I should prefer to speak of other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After that I suppose I ought to consider myself snubbed. But, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;.,
      notwithstanding. I shall simply take the whole confession for granted.
      Now, Mr. Mysterious, I will venture to make three allegations of fact
      about you. Promise to set me right if I am wrong. I assure you I am
      actuated by disinterested motives. All you will have to do will be to say
      yes or no. Promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pledge myself blindfold. But if the &lsquo;allegations of fact&rsquo; are
      within certain limits, I will satisfy you&mdash;although I repeat I would
      prefer a different subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital! Well, then, for a beginner: You are or were or have at some time
      hoped to be, an artist of some sort&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you find that out?&rdquo;&mdash;The query escaped involuntarily. For a
      moment a dread lest he might have discovered my true identity, darkened my
      mind: but it was transitory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You indorse allegation number one! No matter how I found it out. I don&rsquo;t
      really know myself&mdash;unless it was by that instinct which kindred
      spirits have for recognizing one another. But now for allegation number
      two. Its form shall be negative. You are not a painter, a sculptor, an
      actor, or a poet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, neither of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Brava!</i> I could have sworn to it. Therefore you are a musician. And
      I will have the hardihood to guess that your instrument is the violin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess, Mr. Merivale, that you surprise me. You have divined the
      truth, but for the life of me, I don&rsquo;t see how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, by the simplest of possible means. If one is only observing and has
      a knack of putting two and two together, most riddles can easily be
      undone. After our first interview I said, That fellow is above his
      station; after our second, That fellow is an artist; after our third, I&rsquo;ll
      bet my head he is a musician. I have told you it was partly instinct, that
      made me set you down for an artist. It was partly the tone of your
      conversation&mdash;your tendency to warm up over matters pertaining to the
      arts, and to cool down when our talk verged the other way. Then a&mdash;a
      certain ignorance that you betrayed about pictures and books and statuary
      helped on the process of elimination. I concluded that you were a musician&mdash;which
      conclusion was strengthened by the fact of your being a Jew. Music is the
      art in which the Jews excel. And one day a chance attitude that you
      assumed, a twist of the neck, a hitch of the shoulder, cried out <i>Violin!</i>
      as clearly as if by word of mouth&mdash;though no doubt the wish fostered
      the thought, for I have always had a predilection for violinists. Now I
      will go further and declare that a chagrin of one kind or another is
      accountable for your present mode of life. A few years ago I should have
      said: A woman in the case&mdash;disappointment in love&mdash;and so forth.
      Now, having become more worldly, I say: Fear of failure, lack of
      self-confidence. Answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you are such an adept at clairvoyance, I need not answer. But don&rsquo;t
      let this thing become one-sided. You too are an artist, as you have hinted
      and as I had fancied. And your art is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess. I&rsquo;ll wager you&rsquo;ll never guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I confess I am at a loss. You seem equally familiar with all the
      arts. One moment I think you are a painter; the next, a sculptor. I&rsquo;m sure
      you&rsquo;re not a musician. And on the whole it seems most probable that you
      are in some way connected with literature. I don&rsquo;t know why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! You have hit the nail on the head! In spite of my slangy speech and
      my worldly wisdom, learn that I aspire to become a poet! the poet of the
      practical, of the every day, of the passions of modern life. As yet,
      however, I am, as the French put it, <i>inédit</i>. The magazines
      repudiate me. I am too downright, too careless of euphemism, to suit their
      dainty pages. But this is aside from the point. The point is that I want
      to hear you play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible. For me music is a thing of the past. I haven&rsquo;t touched a
      violin these two years. I shall never touch one again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah, bah! Excuse my frankness, but don&rsquo;t be a child. If you haven&rsquo;t
      touched your violin for two years, you have allowed two precious years to
      leak away. All the more reason for stopping the leak at once. Come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had arrived in front of an English-basement house in Seventeenth
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;This is where I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too late,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;It is never too late. Advance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I followed him into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room to which he conducted me was precisely the sort of room one would
      have expected. It was chock-full of odds and ends, piled about in hopeless
      confusion. The walls were hung with a reddish paper, and freckled with
      framed and unframed pictures&mdash;etchings, engravings, water-colors,
      charcoals, some suspended correctly by wires from the cornice, others
      pinned up loosely by their corners. The ceiling was tinted to harmonize
      with the walls. The floor was carpetless, of hard wood, waxed to a high
      degree of slipperiness, and relieved by a sporadic rug or two. Bits of
      porcelain and metal ware, specimens of old Italian carving, Chinese
      sculptures in ivory, rich tapestries, bronze and plaster reproductions of
      antique statuary, and books of all sizes and descriptions and in all
      stages of decay, were scattered hither and thither without a pretense to
      order. On the whole the effect of the room was pleasant, though it
      resembled somewhat closely that of a curiosity-shop gone mad. My host
      informed me that it was Liberty Hall and bade me make myself at home.
      Producing a flagon of Benedictine, he said laconically, &ldquo;Drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We drank together in silence. Turning his emptied glass upside down,
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;now for the music. Now you are going to play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I thought you had forgotten about that,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis not among my talents to forget,&rdquo; he declaimed, theatrically. &ldquo;You
      must prepare to limber up your fingers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr. Merivale,&rdquo; I insisted, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know what you are asking. I
      should no more think of touching a violin to-night than, than&mdash;no
      need of a comparison. The long and short of the matter is that I have the
      best of reasons for not wanting to play, and that the most you can urge to
      the contrary won&rsquo;t alter my resolution. I hate to seem boorish or
      disobliging, but really I can&rsquo;t help it. Besides, my instrument is a mile
      away and unstrung, and it is so late that the other occupants of this
      house would be annoyed. And as the subject is extremely painful to me, I
      wish you would let it drop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you are going to treat the matter <i>au grand sérieux</i>,&rdquo; said
      Merivale, &ldquo;I suppose I must give in. But you have no idea of how
      disappointed I shall be. As for an instrument, I&rsquo;ve a fiddle of my own in
      the next room&mdash;one that I scrape on now and then myself. As for the
      other occupants of this house, I pay double rent on the condition that my
      quarters are to be my castle, and that I can create as much rumpus in
      them, day and night, as I desire. If I were disposed to do so, I could
      make this a broad proposition of ethics, and maintain that as an artist
      you have no right to decline to exercise your skill. Your talent is given
      you in trust&mdash;a trust which you violate when you bury the talent in
      the ground. But I won&rsquo;t go so far as that. I&rsquo;ll simply ask you as a favor
      to play for me, and, if after that you are still obstinate, I&rsquo;ll hold my
      peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am forced to be obstinate. Now let&rsquo;s change the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bow my head. Only, perhaps you will make a single concession. As I have
      said, I am the possessor of a fiddle. It is one I picked up in Rome. I
      bought it of a seedy Italian nobleman; and he claimed it for a rare one&mdash;a
      Stradivari, in fact. I&rsquo;m no judge of such things, and most likely was
      taken in. Will you look at it and give me your opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I have no objection to doing that,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said, glad to prove myself not altogether churlish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; he continued, putting the violin into my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful instrument from an optical standpoint. What remained of
      the varnish was ruddy and crystalline, and as smooth as amber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curves were exquisite. It was also either genuinely old or a marvelous
      imitation. Its interior was dark and dirty&mdash;an excellent condition. I
      could descry no label there&mdash;another favorable sign. Was it indeed a
      Stradivari? Formerly it had been an ambition of mine to play upon a
      Stradivari; an ambition which I had never had a chance to gratify, because
      among the dozen so-called Stradivaris that I had come upon here and there,
      I had found not one but betrayed its fraudulent origin from the instant
      the bow was drawn across the strings. Something of the old feeling revived
      in me as I held this instrument in my hands, and before I had thought, my
      finger mechanically picked the <i>A</i> string. The clear, bell-like tone
      that responded, caused me to start. I had never heard such a tone as this
      produced before by the mere picking of a string.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you have a treasure here,&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not connoisseur
      enough to say whether it is a Stradivari; but whoever its maker was, it&rsquo;s
      a superb instrument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really think so?&rdquo; cried Merivale. &ldquo;Try it with the bow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thrust the bow upon me. Without allowing myself time to hesitate, I
      touched the bow to the strings: the result was a voice from heaven, so
      clear, so broad, so sweet, of such magnetic quality, that it actually
      frightened me, made my heart palpitate, summoned a myriad dead emotions
      back to life. And yet I felt an irresistible temptation to continue, to
      push the experiment at least a trifle further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tune it up,&rdquo; said Merivale.
    </p>
    <p>
      I complied. That was the final stroke. After I had drawn the bow for a
      second time across the cat-gut, there was no resisting. I lost possession
      of myself: ere I knew it, I was pouring my life out through the wonderful
      voice of the Stradivari.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t remember what I played. Most probably it was a medley of
      reminiscences. I only remember that for the first few minutes I suffered
      the tortures of the damned&mdash;an army of devils were tugging at my
      heart-strings&mdash;and withal I had no power to restrain the motion of my
      arm and lay the violin aside. Then, I remember, the pain gradually turned
      to pleasure, to an immense sense of relief, as though all the woe pent up
      in the recesses of my soul had suddenly found an outlet and was gushing
      forth in a tremendous flood of sound. As I felt it ebbing away, like a
      poison let loose from my veins, somehow time and space were annihilated,
      facts were undone, truth changed to falsehood. Veronika and I were alone
      together in the pure realm of spirit while I told her in the million
      tempestuous variations of my music the whole story of my sorrow and my
      adoration. I listened to the music precisely as though it had been played
      by another person; I heard it grow soft and softer and melt into a
      scarcely audible whisper; I heard it soar away into mighty, passionate <i>crescendi</i>;
      I heard it modulate swiftly from prayerful minor to triumphant, defiant
      major; I heard it laugh like a child, plead like a lover, sob like Mary at
      the tomb of Christ; I heard it wax wrathful like a God in anger. And I&mdash;I
      was caught up and borne away and tossed from high to low by it like a leaf
      on the bosom of the ocean. And at last I heard the sharp retort of a
      breaking string; and I sank into a chair, exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I must have come very near to fainting. When I gathered together
      my senses and opened my eyes I was weak, nerveless, bewildered. Merivale
      stood in front of me, his gaze fixed upon my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; I heard him say, &ldquo;tell me what you are. Such music as you
      have played upsets all my established notions, undermines my philosophy,
      forces me back in spite of myself to a belief in witchcraft and magic. Are
      you a Merlin? Have you indeed the secret of enchantment? It is hardly
      credible that simple human genius wove that wonderful web of melody&mdash;which
      has at last come to an end, thank heaven! If I had had to listen a moment
      longer, I should have broken down. The strain was too intense. You have
      taken me with you through hell and heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still weak and nerveless, I could not command my voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are faint,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;The effort has tired you out. No wonder:
      here&mdash;drink this.&rdquo; He held a glass to my lips. I drank its contents.
      Presently I felt a glow of warmth radiating through my limbs. Then I was
      able to stir and to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through hell and heaven,&rdquo; I repeated, echoing his words. &ldquo;Yes, we have
      been through hell and heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a frightful experience,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;more than I bargained for when
      I asked you to play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must forgive me; I was carried away; I had no intention of harrowing
      you, but I had not played for so long a time that my emotions got the best
      of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t talk like that,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;It was a frightful experience,
      but it was one I would not have missed. I had never dreamed that music
      could work such an effect upon me; but now I can understand the ardor with
      which musicians love their art; I can understand the claims they make in
      its behalf. It is indeed the most powerful influence that can be brought
      to bear upon the feelings. For my part I never was so deeply moved before&mdash;not
      even by Dante. But tell me, how did you acquire your wonderful skill? What
      must your life have been in order that you should play like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of &lsquo;wonderful skill&rsquo; I have little enough. Tonight perhaps I played with
      a certain enthusiasm because I was excited. But you attribute too much to
      me. A musician would have descried a score of faults. My technique has
      deserted me; but even when I used to practice regularly, I occupied a very
      low grade in my profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care not how you used to play, nor how you were rated, nor how faulty
      your technique may be. You play now with a force that is more than human.
      I am not given either to flattery or to exaggeration, and I am not easily
      stirred up. But you <i>have</i> stirred me up, clear down to the marrow of
      my bones. Perhaps these two years of abstinence have but ripened the
      genius that was already in you&mdash;allowed it time to ferment. Tell me,
      what depths of joy and sorrow have you sounded to gather the secrets you
      have just revealed with your violin? What has your life been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My life has been a very simple one, and for the most part very prosaic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might as well call the sun cold, the sea motionless, as pretend that
      your life has been prosaic. Friend, the only element that gives life and
      magnetism to art is profound, human truth That which touches us in a
      picture, a poem, or a symphony, is its likeness to the truth, its nature,
      especially its human nature. That is what makes Wilhelm Meister a powerful
      book, because each page is written, so to speak, in human blood. That is
      what makes Titian&rsquo;s Assumption a great picture, because the agony in the
      Madonna&rsquo;s face is true human agony. And that is what gave your music of a
      moment since the power to pierce the very innermost of my heart-because it
      was true music the expression of true human passion. Tell me, what manner
      of life have you lived, to learn so much of the deep things of human
      experience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked into his clear, earnest eyes. They shone with a sympathy that
      fell as balm upon my wounds. An impulse that I could not battle with
      unsealed my lips. I told him my whole story from first to last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the time, as I was speaking, he sat motionless with his brow
      buried in his hands. Some of the time he paced up and down the floor. He
      smoked constantly. Twice or thrice he extended his palm to bid me pause,
      indicating by nodding his head when he wished me to go on. Not once did he
      verbally interrupt, nor for a long while after I had done did he speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by he grasped my hand and wrenched it hard and said, &ldquo;Will&mdash;will
      you understand by my silence what I feel? It would be sacrilege for me to
      talk about this thing. I&mdash;I&mdash;oh, what a fool I am to open my
      mouth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But presently he cried, &ldquo;The injustice, the humiliation, that you have
      been put to! It is shameful. To think that they dared to try you, as
      though the mere sight of your face was not sufficient to prove you
      incapable of the first thought of crime! But I can understand your motive
      for not wishing to hunt the Marshalls down. Only of this I am sure, that
      if there is any such thing as equity in this world, some day their guilt
      will be made manifest and they will receive the chastisement which they
      deserve. Oh, how you have suffered! I tell you, it sobers a man, it
      reminds him of the seriousness of things, the spectacle of such a colossal
      sorrow as yours has been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again silence. Eventually he crossed over to the window and sent the
      curtains rattling across their pole. It was getting light outside. I
      pulled myself together. Rising, &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;good-by. My visit to you
      has been like a sojourn in another world. Now, I must return to my own
      dreary sphere. Forgive me if I have wearied you with all this talk about
      myself. I seemed to speak without meaning to&mdash;involuntarily. Once
      started, I could not have stopped myself, had I tried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak like that,&rdquo; he rejoined hastily and with a look of reproach.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me feel that you repent your confidence. It was only right,
      only natural, that you should unbosom yourself to me. It was the
      consecration of our friendship. Friendship is never complete until it has
      been tested in the fire of sorrow. Mere companionship in pleasure is not
      friendship. No matter how intimately we might have seen each other, we
      should never have been friends until you had told me this.&mdash;Moreover,
      don&rsquo;t get up. You must not think of going away as yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As yet? Why, I have outstaid the night itself. I must make haste or I
      shall be behindhand at the shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not think of returning to the shop to-day. You must go to bed
      and have some sleep. When you awake again I shall have a proposition to
      lay before you. For the present follow me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mr. Merivale&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I anticipate your objections. But they are worthless. But the shop
      may, and I devoutly hope it will, be struck by lightning. Furthermore, if
      you are anxious about it, I&rsquo;ll send word around to the effect that you&rsquo;re
      unwell and not able to report for duty. That&rsquo;s the truth. But any how I
      have a particular reason for wanting to keep possession of you for a while
      longer. Now, be tractable&mdash;as an indulgence, do what I ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no resisting the appeal in Merivale&rsquo;s big blue eyes. I followed
      him as he desired. He led me into the adjoining room, where there were two
      narrow brass bedsteads side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was prepared for you. Here is your couch, ready for
      your reception. It&rsquo;s rather odd about this. I&rsquo;m a great hand for
      presentiments: and experience has taught me to believe in their coming
      true. When I took these quarters I said to myself, &lsquo;Pythias, the Damon you
      have been waiting for all these years will arrive while you are bivouacked
      here. Be therefore in a condition to welcome him properly.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know
      why, but I was thoroughly persuaded, I felt in my bones, that Damon&rsquo;s
      advent would occur during my occupancy of these rooms. So I bought two
      bedsteads and two dressing-stands instead of one. I have got the heroes of
      the old legend somewhat mixed up; can&rsquo;t remember which was which: but I
      trust I&rsquo;m not egotistic in assigning the part of Damon to you and keeping
      that of Pythias for myself. At any rate, it&rsquo;s a mere figure of speech, and
      as such must be taken. Now, Damon or Pythias, whichever you may be, in
      begging you to make yourself comfortable here, I am simply inviting you to
      partake of your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he rattled on thus, he had produced sheets and blankets from a chest of
      drawers near at hand, and now was making the bed with the deftness of an
      expert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he exclaimed, bestowing a farewell poke upon the pillow, &ldquo;now go
      to bed with a clear conscience and a mind at peace. I shall speedily
      follow. In the morning&mdash;I mean in the afternoon&mdash;we will resume
      our session.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had the delicacy to leave me alone. I was too fatigued to reason about
      what I was doing. I undressed quickly, got into bed, and fell sound
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sunlight was streaming through the window when I awoke. Merivale was
      seated upon the foot of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he cried, as I opened my eyes, &ldquo;welcome back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, how?&rdquo; I queried, perplexed for the moment. &ldquo;Oh yes; I remember. Have
      I been asleep long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long that I thought you were never going to wake up. It&rsquo;s past four in
      the afternoon, and you have been sleeping steadily since six this morning.
      I had the utmost hardship in subduing my impatience. Ten solid hours of
      sleep! You must have been thoroughly exhausted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have roused me. One can gorge one&rsquo;s system with sleep as
      easily as with food. I have slept too much. But&mdash;but how shall I ever
      make amends at the shop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bother the shop! The shop no longer exists. I have caused its
      annihilation during the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you Aladdin&rsquo;s lamp?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a substitute for it, at least. The shop has been transported to
      Alaska.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was unkind of you. Now I shall have to undergo the expense of a
      journey thither. Besides, I prefer a more temperate climate.&mdash;But
      seriously, did you send word as you agreed to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw Herr Schwartz personally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that was very thoughtful. Did you succeed in appeasing him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him that you wished to resign your position; and when he began to
      splutter, I added that in consideration of the trouble he would be put to,
      you were willing to forgive him whatever back pay he owed you; and when he
      declared that he owed you no back pay at all, I said you would be willing
      to forgive him any way on general principles, and think no more about it.
      Then I ordered beer and cigars and pronounced the magic syllable &lsquo;<i>selbst</i>&rsquo;
      and in the end he appeared quite reconciled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense. Be serious. What did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>am</i> serious. That is what I said precisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, you&mdash;oh come, you can&rsquo;t be in earnest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I assure you I am in earnest, never was more in earnest in my life.
      You don&rsquo;t really imagine that I am going to let you &lsquo;stand and wait&rsquo; any
      longer, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t very clearly see how you are going to prevent it. I have my
      livelihood to earn. I can&rsquo;t afford to throw up my employment in the
      cavalier manner you propose. It&rsquo;s ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can prevent it and I will prevent it. How? By the power of friendship,
      by appealing to your heart and to your reason. As for your livelihood, I
      have found you a new occupation, one more befitting your character.
      Henceforward you are to be a private secretary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose private secretary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind whose&mdash;or rather, you will learn whose, presently. First,
      accustom your mind to the abstract idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Merivale, you are outrageous. I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m not indignant.
      You meddle with my affairs as if they were your own. You have no right to
      do so. And yet I am not angry. I must be totally devoid of spunk. But
      nevertheless I shan&rsquo;t abide by your proceedings. As soon as I am dressed I
      shall return to the shop and beg Herr Schwartz to take me back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forbid it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, but I must defy your prohibition. By the way, may I inquire
      your authority?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. It is every man&rsquo;s authority to restrain a lunatic. Your notion
      of returning to that wine-shop is downright lunacy. Besides, have I not
      provided you with new employment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is a sort of employment which I don&rsquo;t wish to undertake. I prefer
      work that will leave my mind disengaged. You ought to understand that in
      my position one has no heart for any but manual labor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I understand perfectly, better indeed than you yourself. I
      understand that while the first shock of your grief lasted it was natural
      for you to take up the first employment that you chanced upon, no matter
      what it was. But I understand now that it is high time for you to come
      back to your proper level. An occupation which leaves your mind disengaged
      is precisely the very worst you could have. With all appreciation of the
      magnitude of your bereavement, and with all reverence for your fidelity to
      your betrothed, I say that it is wrong of you to brood over your troubles.
      I am not brute enough to advise you to court oblivion; but a grief loses
      its dignity, becomes a species of egotism, by constantly brooding over it.
      It is our duty in this world to accept the inevitable with the best grace
      possible, and to make ourselves as comfortable as under the circumstances
      we can. But over and above that consideration there is this, that no man
      has a right to do work that is unworthy of him. It degrades himself and it
      robs society. Every man is bound to do his best work, to accomplish his
      highest usefulness. What would you say of a Newton who had abandoned
      mathematics to drive a plow? You are as much subject to the general moral
      law as the rest of us. You were sent into this world to contribute your
      quota to the sum of human happiness; and your art was permitted you only
      on the condition that you should cultivate it for the benefit of your
      fellow creatures. And yet, you propose to do the business of a common
      waiter in a wretched little <i>brasserie</i>. Now, I won&rsquo;t urge you to
      return to music forthwith, because I know you suffer too keenly while you
      are playing. But I will say: Remember that you are a gentleman and that
      you are actually stealing from society by doing that which your inferiors
      could do as well. For the present, accept the situation of private
      secretary that I have procured for you. It will be a stepping-stone toward
      your proper place. You see, I can be a preacher on occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your sermon, I confess, is a wholesome one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will consider the secretaryship?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will consider whatever you wish me to. I will be guided by your common
      sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Now get up and dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the room. As I dressed I thought over the sermon he had preached.
      I could not gainsay its truth. Yet on the other hand I could not
      contemplate a changed mode of life without flinching. Two years of moral
      illness had undermined my moral courage. I wondered who my new employer
      was to be. I dreaded meeting him not a little. Thinking over the
      confidences of the night, I experienced no regret. Indeed I was glad to
      realize that I was no longer altogether alone in the world. Merivale had
      inspired me with an enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a splendid fellow he is!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he and I could only remain together I believe I should find my life
      worth living. It is marvelous, the faculty he has for making me forget
      myself. I suppose it is due to his animal spirits, his healthy
      temperament. He is as vigorous and bracing as a whiff of the west wind
      full in one&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had never had a friend before. I relished my first taste of friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime I was preparing my toilet. In the midst of it Merivale came into
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you know who your future master is to be?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;how should I know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you obtuse blockhead! You&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mean to say&mdash;&rdquo; I began, a suspicion of the
      truth dawning upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly! That is the precise sum and substance of what I mean to say. I
      mean to say that I&rsquo;m in need of somebody to help me in certain work that
      I&rsquo;m doing. The need is a real one, not an artificial one trumped up for
      the occasion. I have plenty of cash and am ready to pay what is just for
      my assistant&rsquo;s time. You on the other hand are looking about fora means of
      subsistence. At the same time, luckily, you are just the person to suit my
      purpose. Hence, as a pure matter of business, I say, Shall we strike a
      bargain? You are going to be sensible and answer, Yes. Wherefore it only
      remains for me to explain the nature of the work and thus to convince you
      that you are not going to draw the salary of a sinecure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this is really true,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help telling you that nothing
      could make me happier. If I can really be of service to you, and if we can
      really arrange to keep as closely together as such work would bring us,
      why, my contentment will be greater than I can say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then come into the next room and judge for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We passed into the sitting-room. Merivale drew up to a table near the
      window and taking a pen in his hand said, &ldquo;Look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried the pen&rsquo;s nib upon the nail of his thumb, dipped it into an
      inkstand, and applied it to a blank sheet of paper. Then his fingers began
      to work laboriously to and fro, with the result of tracing a scarcely
      legible scrawl. One could, however, by dint of taxing the imagination,
      make out these words: &ldquo;Good friend, to end all doubt about the present
      matter, learn by this that a penman&rsquo;s palsy shakes my fist, and
      furthermore, that I inherit a lamentable tendency to gout in the wrist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scrivener&rsquo;s palsy and gout combined,&rdquo; he added verbally, &ldquo;and yet I am
      going to publish a volume of poems in the spring. They&rsquo;re all down on
      paper, but no one can decipher them except myself; and if I should be
      carried off some day unexpectedly, think what the world would lose! My
      idea is to dictate them to you. We will work from nine till one every day,
      and devote the rest of our time to relaxation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you take my handwriting for granted,&rdquo; I interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I am safe in doing so,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But give me a sample.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wrote off a few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; was his comment. &ldquo;Now about the compensation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had to haggle with my generous friend and to beat him down half of his
      original offer. My stipend settled, &ldquo;I admit,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I am
      ravenously hungry. Suppose we dine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We adjourned to Moretti&rsquo;s. During the dinner we discussed our future. He
      said he was constantly writing new matter and therefore our contract would
      not terminate with the completion of the particular MS. in question. &ldquo;Ah,
      what good times we are going to enjoy!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We are perfectly
      companionable! There is nothing so satisfactory, nothing so productive of
      <i>bien être</i>, as friendship, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dinner over, we strolled arm in arm through the streets. For the first
      time in two years I began to feel that the world was not quite a ruin. At
      home we talked till late into the night. And when I went to bed it was to
      lie awake for hours and hours, congratulating myself upon my newly
      discovered friend.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N the morrow
      morning our régime was inaugurated: and thenceforward we kept it up
      regularly. From nine till one I wrote at his dictation. The task was by no
      means irksome.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoyed my friend&rsquo;s poetry: and besides, we varied the business with
      frequent interruptions for conversation and cigarettes. Merivale taught me
      to smoke&mdash;a vice, if it be a vice, from which I have since derived no
      little solace. At one o&rsquo;clock our luncheon was served up to us by the lady
      of the house: and the remainder of the day we employed as best suited our
      fancy. Sometimes we would take turns at reading aloud. In this way we read
      much of Browning and Rossetti, two poets till then total strangers to me.
      Sometimes we would saunter about the lower quarters of the city. Merivale
      never tired of the glimpses these excursions afforded into the life of the
      common people. He maintained that New York was the most picturesque city
      in the world, &ldquo;thanks,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to the presence of your people, the
      Jews.&rdquo; Sometimes we would visit the picture galleries, where my friend
      initiated me into the enjoyment of a new art. Musician-like, I had
      theretofore cared little and understood nothing about painting. Merivale
      was fond of quoting the German dictum, &ldquo;<i>Das Sehen mussgelernt sein!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;it
      was all the German he knew&mdash;and now he taught me to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in precisely the mood to appreciate this altered mode of existence
      to the utmost. At Merivale&rsquo;s touch the pain that for two years had been as
      a lump in my throat was dissolved and diffused, tinging my life with
      melancholy instead of consuming it with sullen, unremitting fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scowl,&rdquo; declared my friend, &ldquo;the scowl is merging into a smile of
      sadness. &lsquo;Tis a hopeful sign. By and by your cure will be established. You
      have had a cancer, as it were. We have succeeded in scattering the virus
      through the system. Now we will proceed to its total eradication. I don&rsquo;t
      know whether that is the course medical men in general pursue: but it
      sounds plausible, and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s the proper one for the present
      instance. Of course I don&rsquo;t expect you ever to rejoice in that unalloyed
      buoyancy of spirits which distinguishes your servant: but you will become
      cheerful and contented; and the Italians say, &lsquo;Whoso is contented is
      happy.&rsquo;.rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if his predictions were being verified. Though at no time did
      I cease to think of Veronika, though at no time did I become insensible of
      the loss I had sustained, still the fact was that I commenced to take an
      interest in what went on around me, commenced in a certain sense to
      extract pleasure from my circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been a dreadful egotist,&rdquo; said Merivale, &ldquo;profoundly
      self-absorbed. It was inevitable that you should be for a while. But there
      is no excuse for you to be so any longer. A purely selfish sorrow is as
      much a self-indulgence as a purely selfish joy, and has as little dignity.
      It dwarfs, enervates, demoralizes the soul: a platitude which you would do
      well to memorize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At first I had hesitated to try a second experiment with the violin: yet
      the very motive of my hesitancy&mdash;namely, the recollection of how my
      feelings had got the best of me the last time&mdash;acted also as a
      temptation. One day while Merivale was absent I tuned his Stradivari, and
      with much the sensation of a fledgling launched upon a perilous and
      uncertain flight, let my right arm have its way. The result was
      encouraging. I determined that henceforward I should practice regularly.
      The music brought me near to Veronika, and now I could endure this
      nearness without quailing. Though it was by no means destitute of pain,
      somehow the very pain was a luxury. Henceforth not a day passed without my
      dedicating several hours to the violin. Merivale, as he had put it,
      &ldquo;scraped a little.&rdquo; He had put it too modestly. He had already learned to
      read with remarkable facility; and instruction profited him to such a
      degree that he was soon able to sustain a very accurate second. So when we
      were at loss for another occupation we would while the hours away with
      Schubert&rsquo;s songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      We spent most of our evenings in-doors, chatting at the fireside.
      Sometimes Merivale would take himself off to pay a visit in the town. Then
      I would invariably fall to marveling at the change he had wrought in my
      life. &ldquo;It is certain,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that Destiny holds some happiness still in
      store for you.&rdquo; I was mistaken. Destiny was simply granting me a momentary
      respite&mdash;drawing off, preparatory to delivering her final culminating
      blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night Merivale came home late. I, indeed, had already gone to bed. He
      roused me by lighting the gas and crying, &ldquo;Wake up, wake up; I have
      something of the utmost importance to communicate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the house afire?&rdquo; I demanded, startled. &ldquo;No; the house is all right.
      But rub your eyes and open your ears. Do you know Dr. Rodolph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The musical director?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I know him by reputation. Do you mean personally? Why do you
      ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;but that&rsquo;s the point. First you must hear my story. It&rsquo;s
      the greatest stroke of luck that mortal ever had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going ahead as rapidly as I can; only I&rsquo;m so excited I hardly know
      where to begin. I&rsquo;ve actually run on foot all the way home. I couldn&rsquo;t
      wait for the horse-car, I was in such a hurry to announce your good
      fortune. I&rsquo;m rather out of breath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your time, then. I possess my soul in patience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s the amount of it.&mdash;You see, Dr. Rodolph is a friend of
      mine, and this evening I thought I would call upon him. The thought proved
      to be a happy one, a veritable inspiration. I arrived just in the nick of
      time. We hadn&rsquo;t more than seated ourselves in the drawing-room when the
      door-bell rang. Martha, the doctor&rsquo;s daughter, went to answer it; and
      presently back she came bearing a note for her father. The doctor took it
      and asked permission to read it and broke it open. You know what a nervous
      little man he is. Well, the next moment he began to grow red, and his
      nostrils dilated, and his eyes flashed fire, and then he crumpled up the
      paper and stamped his foot and uttered a tremendous imprecation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pray, don&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; I said, as he paused for breath. &ldquo;Your narrative
      becomes thrilling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; resumed Merivale, &ldquo;I got quite alarmed. I rushed up to the
      doctor&rsquo;s side and &lsquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake, what&rsquo;s the matter&mdash;no bad news,
      I hope,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;Bad news?&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I should think it was bad news,&rsquo;
      giving his mane a toss. &lsquo;To-day is Friday, isn&rsquo;t it? To-day we had our
      public rehearsal. To-morrow night we have our concert. Good. Well, now at
      the eleventh hour what happens? Why, the soloist sends word that &ldquo;a sudden
      indisposition will make it impossible for him to keep his engagement.&rdquo;
       Ugh! I hope it is an apoplexy, but I&rsquo;m afraid it s nothing more nor less
      than rum. The advertisements are all in the papers; the programme is
      arranged on the assumption that he is to play; and now, late as it is, I
      shall have to start out in search of a substitute.&rsquo; &lsquo;Hold on a minute,
      doctor,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;What instrument did your soloist intend to play?&rsquo; &lsquo;The
      violin,&rsquo; says the doctor. &lsquo;Hurrah!&rsquo; I rejoined, &lsquo;then you need seek no
      further!&rsquo; &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; asked he. &lsquo;This,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;that I will
      supply a substitute who can take the wind all out of your delinquent&rsquo;s
      sails.&rsquo; The doctor raised his eyebrows. &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t
      nonsense,&rsquo; I replied, and thereupon I told him about you&mdash;that is
      about your wonderful skill as a fiddler. Well, of course the doctor was
      disinclined to believe in you; said that excellence was not enough; the
      public would tolerate mere excellence in a singer or in a pianist, but
      when it came to violin solos, the public demanded something superlative or
      nothing at all; it wasn&rsquo;t possible that you could be up to the mark,
      because he had never heard of you. Of course, if I said so, he had no
      doubt that you were a good musician, but he had twenty good musicians in
      his orchestra. A good musician wasn&rsquo;t enough.&mdash;But I didn&rsquo;t mean to
      be turned aside by this sort of obstacle. I insisted. I said I had heard
      Joachim and all the best players on the other side, and that you were able
      to give them lessons. The doctor pooh-poohed me. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t
      damage your friend&rsquo;s chances by exaggeration. I should be only too much
      pleased if he should turn out to be a competent man; but you add to my
      incredulity when you measure him with a giant like Joachim. At any rate, I
      am willing to give him a trial. Bring him here to-morrow morning.&rsquo; So
      to-morrow morning, bright and early, we will call upon the doctor, and&mdash;and
      your fortune&rsquo;s made!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It required no little strength of mind to answer Merivale as I now had to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re awfully kind, old boy,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s extremely hard to be obliged
      to say no. But really, you don&rsquo;t understand the level of violin playing
      which a soloist must come up to. And you don&rsquo;t understand either what a
      mediocre executant I am. My technique is such that I could barely pass
      muster among the second violinists in Doctor Rodolph&rsquo;s orchestra. It would
      be the height of effrontery for me to present myself before him as a
      would-be soloist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a matter for the doctor, and not for you, to decide. No man can
      correctly estimate his own powers: you not more than the rest. All I say
      is, come with me to call upon him to-morrow morning and leave the
      consequences to his judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not submit me to the humiliation of such a trial. After the
      extravagances you have uttered concerning me, to show myself in my own
      humble colors&mdash;the drop would be too great. But I may as well be
      entirely candid. There are other reasons, final ones. I may as well say
      right out that it will never be possible for me to play my violin anywhere
      except here, between you and me: you know why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The light faded from Merivale&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;After the trouble I&rsquo;ve taken, and after
      the promise I&rsquo;ve made, and after the pleasure I&rsquo;ve had in picturing your
      delight, don&rsquo;t say you won&rsquo;t even go to see the Doctor and give him a
      specimen. Don&rsquo;t disappoint a fellow like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stuck out obdurately. Merivale shifted from the attitude of one who begs
      a favor to that of one who imposes a duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;it is simply the old egotism reasserting itself. You
      won&rsquo;t play, forsooth, because it doesn&rsquo;t suit your humor. That, I say, is
      egotism of the worst sort. You&mdash;positively, you make me ashamed for
      you. It is the part of a man to perform his task manfully. What right have
      you, I&rsquo;d like to know, what right have you to hide your light under a
      bushel, more than another? Simply because the practice of your art entails
      pain upon you, are you justified in resting idle? Why, all great work
      entails pain upon the worker. Raphael never would have painted his
      pictures, Dante never would have written his Inferno, women would never
      bring children into the world, if the dread of pain were sufficient to
      subdue courage and the sense of obligation. It is the pain which makes the
      endeavor heroic. I have all due respect for your feelings, Lexow; but I
      respect them only in so far as I believe that you are able to master them.
      When I see them get the upper hand and sap your manhood, then I counsel
      you to a serious battle with them. The excuse you offer for not wishing to
      play to-morrow night is a puny excuse. I will have none of it. To-morrow
      morning you will go with me to Doctor Rodolph&rsquo;s: and if after this homily
      you persist in your refusal&mdash;well, you&rsquo;ll know my opinion of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Merivale would not listen to my protests. He got into bed and said,
      &ldquo;Good-night. Go to sleep. No use for you to talk. I&rsquo;m deaf. I&rsquo;m implacable
      also; and to-morrow morning I shall lead you to the slaughter. Prepare to
      trot along becomingly at my side, lambkin. Goodnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My efforts to beg off next morning were ineffectual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you desire to forfeit my respect entirely,&rdquo; he warned me, &ldquo;persist in
      this sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I permitted myself to be dragged by the arm through the streets to Doctor
      Rodolph&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor accorded me a skeptical welcome. Producing a composition quite
      unfamiliar to me, he bade me read it at sight. I made up my mind to do my
      best. The doctor sat in an easy chair during the first dozen bars. Then he
      began to move nervously about the loom. Then, before I had half finished,
      he cried out, &ldquo;Stop&mdash;enough, enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Disconcerted, I brought my bow to a standstill and exchanged a forlorn
      glance with Merivale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor approached and looked me quizzically over from head to foot.
      &ldquo;Where did you study?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In New York,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever played in public?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at any large affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you teach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what did you say your name was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lexow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum, it is odd I haven&rsquo;t heard of you. Have you been in New York long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; you said you studied here. Who were your masters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I named them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor&rsquo;s face had been inscrutable. Merivale and I had sat on pins
      during the inquisition. Now the doctor&rsquo;s face lighted up with a genial
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do, Mr. Lexow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whom to thank the more,
      you or Mr. Merivale. You have relieved me in a very trying emergency. Your
      playing is fine, though perhaps a trifle too independent, a trifle too
      individual, and the least tone too florid. It is odd, most odd that I
      should never have heard of you; but we shall all hear of you in the
      future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We agreed upon the selections for the evening. I ran them through in the
      doctor&rsquo;s presence and listened to his suggestions. Then we bade him
      good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day was a trying one. It would be bootless to catalogue the
      conflicting thoughts and emotions that preyed upon me. I practiced my
      pieces thoroughly. Merivale busied himself procuring what he styled a
      &ldquo;rig.&rdquo; The rig consisted of an evening suit and its accessories. He rented
      one at a costumer&rsquo;s on Union square. As the day drew to a close, I worried
      more and more. &ldquo;Brace up,&rdquo; cried Merivale. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your stamina? And
      here, swallow a glass of brandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We waited in the ante-room till it was my turn to go upon the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was conscious of a glow of light and a sea of faces and a mortal
      stage-fright, and of little else, when finally I had taken my position.
      The orchestra played the preliminary bars. I had to begin. I got through
      the first phrase and the second. The voice of my instrument reassured me.
      &ldquo;After all you will not make a dead failure,&rdquo; I thought, and ventured to
      lift my eyes. Not two yards distant from me, to my right, among the first
      violins, sat Mr. Tikulski. His gaze was riveted upon my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had anticipated about every catastrophe that could possibly befall, but
      strangely enough I had not anticipated this. And it was so sudden, and the
      emotions it occasioned were so powerful, and I was so nervous and unstrung&mdash;well,
      the floor gave a lurch, like the deck of a vessel in a storm; the lights
      dashed backward and forward before my sight; a deathly sickness overspread
      my senses; the accompaniment of the orchestra became harsh and incoherent;
      my violin dropped with a crash upon the boards; and the next thing I was
      aware of, I lay at full length on a sofa in the retiring-room, and
      Merivale was holding a smelling-bottle to my nostrils. I could hear the
      orchestra beyond the partition industriously winding off the <i>Tannhauser</i>
      march.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo; asked Merivale, as I opened my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel as though I should like to annihilate myself,&rdquo; I answered, as
      memory cleared up. &ldquo;I have permanently disgraced us both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what was the trouble? You were doing nobly, splendidly, when all of a
      sudden you collapsed like that,&rdquo; clapping his hands. &ldquo;The doctor is
      furious, says it was all my fault.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t your fault,&rdquo; I hastened
      to put in. &ldquo;I should have pulled through after a fashion, only unluckily I
      caught sight of Tikulski&mdash;her uncle, you know&mdash;in the orchestra;
      and, well, I&mdash;I suppose&mdash;well, you see it was so unexpected that
      it rather undid me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I understand,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      We kept silence all the way home in the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, as I entered the sitting-room, Merivale tried to hide a
      newspaper under his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t bother to do that,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Of course it is all in print?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Possessing myself of the newspaper, I had the satisfaction of reading a
      sensational account of my fiasco. But what I had most dreaded from the
      quarter of the newspapers had not come to pass. None of them identified me
      as the Ernest Neuman who, rather more than two years since, had been tried
      for murder.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>Y encounter with
      Tikulski was bound to have consequences, practical as well as moral. All
      day Sunday a legion of blue devils were my comrades. Late Monday afternoon
      I received by the post a letter and a package, each addressed to &ldquo;E.
      Lexow, in care of D. Merivale, Esq.&rdquo; The penmanship was the same on both&mdash;a
      stiff European hand which I could not recognize. I began with the letter.
      It read thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. E. Lexow,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have forwarded this to you before, but not apprised of the
      alteration of your name, I was unable to discover your address. I dispatch
      this to the address indicated by Dr. Rodolph, who informs me that you are
      to be reached through D. Merivale, Esquire, as he is not advised of your
      private residence. I found it in a pawnbroking establishment (No.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-street,
      kept by one M. Arkush) now more than a year, and purchased it with the
      intention of restoring it to you, because I suppose that it must be of
      some value to you as a family memento, and that you would not have
      disposed of it except needing money. Hoping that this letter may find you
      in the enjoyment of good health, I am
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Respectfully yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B. Tikulski.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What could Tikulski&rsquo;s letter mean? What could &ldquo;it&rdquo; be? I puzzled over
      these questions for a long while before it occurred to me to unseal the
      package.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an outer wrapper of stout brown paper. Beneath this, an inner
      wrapper of tissue paper. Both removed, I beheld an oval case of red
      leather, considerably the worse for wear. What did it contain? I pressed
      the clasp and raised the lid. It contained a miniature painted on ivory,
      the likeness of a man. The faded colors and the old-fashioned collar and
      cravat showed that it dated from some years back. But of whom was it a
      picture?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why had Tikulski posted it to me? And what did he mean by supposing that I
      should value it as a family memento and that I would not have parted with
      it&mdash;I, who had never owned it,&mdash;&ldquo;except needing money?&rdquo; I was
      thoroughly mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merivale,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;can you make any thing out of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tossed him the letter and the portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he muttered, &ldquo;Pretty good, by Jove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; I questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you make of it? What does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that the likeness is striking, what else? Your father, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father? I confess I am in the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have the faculty of dragging me in after you. What are you trying
      to get at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am trying to get at Mr. Tikulski&rsquo;s idea. Why should he send me that
      miniature? Whom does it represent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that you haven&rsquo;t recognized it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man alive, look in the glass.&mdash;Here.&rdquo; Merivale held up the miniature
      in one hand and a pocket-mirror in the other. As closely as it is possible
      for one human countenance to resemble another, the face of the picture
      resembled my reflection in the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you satisfied?&rdquo; demanded Merivale.&mdash;&ldquo;Why, what ails you?&rdquo; he
      continued presently, as I did not answer. &ldquo;You look as if you had seen a
      ghost. Are you ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has caused me quite a turn,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;It must indeed be a portrait
      of my father. But do you know&mdash;wait&mdash;let me tell you something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What I told Merivale I shall have also to tell the reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could remember neither of my parents. As a child, I had lived in a dark
      old house with a good old rabbi and his wife&mdash;Dr. and Mrs. Hirsch. I
      had never stopped to ask whether or not they were my father and mother
      until I was eleven or twelve years of age. Then, the question having been
      suggested by a schoolmate, I had said, &ldquo;Dr. Lesser&rdquo;&mdash;Lesser being the
      rabbi&rsquo;s given name&mdash;&ldquo;are you my father?&rdquo; To which the doctor, beaming
      at me over the rim of his spectacles, had responded, &ldquo;No, my child: you
      are an orphan.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;An orphan? That means?&rdquo; I pursued. &ldquo;That your papa
      and mamma are dead,&rdquo; said he.&mdash;&ldquo;Have they been dead long?&rdquo; I asked
      indifferently. &ldquo;Ever since you were the tiniest little tot,&rdquo; he replied.
      And thereupon, as the subject did not prove especially interesting, I had
      let it drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time went on. I was perfectly contented. The doctor and his wife were
      kindness personified. The present occupied me so pleasantly that I forgot
      to be curious about the past. But at length, when I was fifteen, the
      question of my parentage was again brought to my mind&mdash;this time by a
      lad with whom I had had a quarrel and who as a parting thrust had inquired
      significantly whether I knew the definition of the Hebrew noun <i>Mamzer</i>.
      Highly incensed, I ran home and burst into the doctor&rsquo;s study. &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; I
      demanded, without ceremony, &ldquo;am I a <i>Mamzer?</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What a notion!
      Of course you are not,&rdquo; replied the rabbi.&mdash;&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I continued,
      &ldquo;what am I? Tell me all about my father and mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor said there was nothing to tell except that my mother had died
      when I was less than two years old, and my father not a great while after
      her. They had been members of his (the doctor&rsquo;s) congregation; and rather
      than see me sent to an orphan asylum, he and his wife had taken me to live
      with them.&mdash;&ldquo;But what sort of people were they, my parents?&rdquo; I
      insisted. &ldquo;Give me some particulars about them.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;They were very
      respectable, and by their neighbors generally esteemed well off. Your
      father had been a merchant; but for the last year his health was such as
      to confine him to his bedroom. It was quite a surprise to every body to
      find on his death that very little property was left. That little was
      gobbled up by his creditors. So that you have no legacy to expect except&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except?&rdquo; I queried as the doctor hesitated. &ldquo;There is no exception. You
      have no legacy to expect at all.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I resumed, &ldquo;had my parents
      no relations? Have I no uncles or aunts? Am I altogether without kindred?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;So
      far as I know, you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Your father came originally from Breslau. It is possible that he had
      relatives there; but he had none in this country&mdash;at least I never
      heard him speak of any. He was a good man, a pious man. It was sad that he
      should die so young, but it was the will of <i>Adonai</i>&mdash;&ldquo;And my
      mother, had she no brother or sister?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;About your mother I can tell
      you very little. She came from Savannah. Whether she has connections there
      still, I can not say.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; I asked, after a moment&rsquo;s silence,
      &ldquo;what did you mean by that &lsquo;except&rsquo; you used a while ago, speaking of
      legacies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant nothing. I was thinking of a few family relics, papers and
      what-not, which you are to receive when you become of age.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Why not
      till then?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No reason, save that such was your father&rsquo;s wish,
      expressed on his death-bed. He said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let my son have these until he
      is grown to be a man.&rsquo;.&mdash;&ldquo;Can you tell me definitely what they are?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
      can not. I have never seen them. They are locked up in a box; and the box
      I am not at liberty to open.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Doctor, what was my mother&rsquo;s
      maiden-name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertha, Bertha Lexow.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Did you marry her and my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; they were married in the South at Savannah. I think they had been
      married about five years when your father died.&rdquo;&mdash;I went on quizzing
      the doctor until he declined to answer another question. &ldquo;Go away,
      gad-fly,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You are worse than the inquisition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In my eighteenth year the doctor died suddenly, having survived his wife
      by a six-month only. He was stricken down by paralysis while intoning the
      <i>Kadesh</i> song in the synagogue. In him I lost my only friend. I had
      loved him precisely as though he had been my father. His death was an
      immense affliction. It took me a long while to gather my wits together and
      realize my position.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week or two after the funeral a man came to me and said, &ldquo;I represent
      the Public Administrator, charged with settling up Dr. Hirsch&rsquo;s concerns.
      He leaves nothing except household furniture and a few dollars in bank&mdash;all
      of which goes to his next-of-kin in Germany. You will have to find other
      quarters. These are to be vacated and the goods sold at auction in a few
      days.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if you are his administrator, that reminds me.
      I beg that you will deliver over the things the doctor had belonging to me&mdash;a
      box containing papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Identify your property and prove your title,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangers came and went in and out of the house for several days. But in
      the inventory which they prepared no such box as the doctor had described
      was mentioned. Furthermore, a thorough search failed to bring it to light.
      The auction was held. The last fork was knocked down to the highest
      bidder. And I had to go about my business with the unpleasant conviction
      that owing to some slip-up somewhere my inheritance had either been lost
      or stolen. Gradually I reconciled myself to this idea, concluding that
      what I already knew about my parents was the most I ever should know; and
      thus matters had remained ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now,&rdquo; I added, my recital wound up, &ldquo;now perhaps in this miniature I
      have a clew. It must be a portrait of my father: and very likely it was
      part of the contents of that box. I suppose, if I were clever, I should
      see a way of following it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am consoled,&rdquo; said Merivale, drawing a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consoled?&rdquo; I queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, consoled for my obstinacy in making you play at the concert. You
      see, it was an inspiration after all. If you had not chanced upon Tikulski&mdash;what
      a blood-curdling name! fit for a tragedy villain&mdash;if you hadn&rsquo;t
      chanced upon him as you did, why you never would have received the
      picture, and so the mystery which envelops my hero s antecedents would
      never have been dispelled. Now we must go to work in a systematic way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly; but how begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see Tikulski&rsquo;s letter again.&rdquo;&mdash;After he had read the letter,
      &ldquo;Begin, he said, by paying a visit to the pawn-shop where he got it.
      Luckily he had the presence of mind to mention its whereabouts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; I assented. &ldquo;But will you go with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you imagine I would allow you to go alone, you unfledged gosling? I
      shall not only go with you, but by your permission I shall manage the
      whole transaction. I fancy I surpass you in respect of <i>savoir faire</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is now past four. Shall we start at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too hopeful,&rdquo; he warned me, as we approached the pawnbroker&rsquo;s
      door. &ldquo;Most likely we shall run against a dead wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shop was empty. A bell tinkled as we opened the door. In response, a
      young fellow in his shirt-sleeves emerged from a dark back room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Arkush in?&rdquo; demanded Merivale, with an air of friendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to see him personally?&rdquo; returned the young man, not over
      politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have fathomed my purpose,&rdquo; said Merivale with mock gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Merivale drew near to the young man and shielding his mouth with his hand
      whispered, &ldquo;Business,&rdquo; accompanying his utterance with a knowing glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can see me about business,&rdquo; rejoined his interlocutor, surlily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible. Here, take my card to Mr. Arkush and say I am pressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Arkush can&rsquo;t see nobody. He&rsquo;s sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sick? Ah, indeed?&rdquo; cried Merivale. &ldquo;Has he been sick long? I hope it is
      nothing serious. Pray tell me what the trouble is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked surprised. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s only rheumatism,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
      ain&rsquo;t a friend of his, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my dear fellow, of course I am. By the very nature of his profession
      Mr. Arkush is the friend of every body; and I am the friend of every
      friend of mine. Consequently but the deduction is too obvious. Here, take
      him my card and say that if he is not too ill I shall hope to be
      admitted.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps I&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; said the young man, reflectively.&mdash;&ldquo;Becky,&rdquo;
       he called, raising his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Becky appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-afternoon, Miss Rebecca,&rdquo; said Merivale, lifting his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind the shop,&rdquo; said the young man to Becky, and thereat vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come this way,&rdquo; he said to us, presently returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He conducted us into the cavernous back room. The atmosphere was heavy
      with the scent of stale cookery. The walls were lined with shelves,
      bearing mysterious parcels done up in paper winding-sheets. Under a grimy
      window at the further end an old man sat in an easy chair, a patch-work
      quilt infolding his legs. Bald, beardless, with sharply accentuated
      features and a yellow skin, he looked like a Midas whose magic was
      beginning to operate upon himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; cried Merivale, advancing toward him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m shocked to find you
      suffering like this, Mr. Arkush. Do the legs give you much pain? You must
      try petroleum liniment. I&rsquo;ll send you a bottle. They say it&rsquo;s the best
      remedy in the world.&mdash;But tell me, how are you getting on? Do you
      notice any improvement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s face wore a puzzled expression. &ldquo;What was the business you
      wanted to see me about?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind about business till you have quieted my anxiety regarding
      your health. Besides, are you sure you will be able to attend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mask of Midas betrayed a tendency to smile. &ldquo;Come, time is money;
      hurry up,&rdquo; said its owner. He had a strong Jewish accent, thus: &ldquo;Dime iss
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Merivale, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t think it will disturb you, I&rsquo;ll
      come to the point. But let me disarm beforehand any suspicion which the
      nature of my errand may be calculated to inspire. I am <i>not</i> a
      detective. I am <i>not</i> on the track of stolen goods. I am simply a
      private individual desirous of gaining certain information for certain
      strictly legitimate ends. So you need have no fear of compromising
      yourself by speaking with entire unreserve. Shall I proceed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Gott, what are you talking about? Don&rsquo;t make foolishness any longer,&rdquo;
       exclaimed Mr. Arkush with some degree of vivacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Arkush,&rdquo; said Merivale in his most solemn tones, &ldquo;do you remember
      this?&rdquo; extracting the miniature from his pocket and handing it to the
      pawnbroker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter donned a pair of spectacles and holding the picture off at
      arm&rsquo;s length, scrutinized it in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember it,&rdquo; he replied finally, &ldquo;I sold it to a gentleman some
      time ago. What of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did. You sold it about a year ago to a gentleman with a white beard.
      Recollect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, yes: you are right. He had a white beard. He was also a Jew. We
      spoke in <i>Judisch</i>. I remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, hasn&rsquo;t Mr. Arkusha wonderful memory?&rdquo; cried Merivale, turning to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I happen to remember,&rdquo; volunteered Mr. Arkush, unperturbed by the
      compliment, &ldquo;because when I put that article into the window I said to
      myself, &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t get no customer for that. What good is it to anyone?
      You made a mistake to lend your money on it. That was a loss.&rsquo; But the
      very same day the old gentleman came in and bought it, which was a
      surprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see. Could you tell me, Mr. Arkush, of whom you got it originally&mdash;who
      pledged it with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Du lieber Gott!</i> how should I remember that? It was two years ago
      already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, but&mdash;but your books would show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my books would show the name the person gave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, will you kindly refer to your books?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ach, you make me much trouble!&mdash;Yakub,&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arkush told Yakub to get him the ledger for 18&mdash;. It was a ponderous
      and dingy volume. Yakub held it open while his employer turned the pages,
      running his finger from the top to the bottom of each. At length the
      finger reached a stand-still. Mr. Arkush said, &ldquo;Yes, I have found it. It
      was pawned with me by a man calling himself Joseph White.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The date?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The 16th January.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any means of recalling what sort of looking individual Joseph
      White was? And, by the way, is his residence given?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Residence, Harlem,&rsquo; it says. That&rsquo;s all. How should I remember his
      looks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&mdash;you see so many people in the course of a year, it is not
      wonderful that you should forget.&mdash;But tell me, did White put any
      thing else in pawn that day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; nothing else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He simply pawned this one article and went away; that&rsquo;s all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Merivale reflected. At length he resumed. &ldquo;But at any other time&mdash;that
      is, does White&rsquo;s name appear on your ledger under any other date?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you expect me to read through the book?&rdquo; inquired Arkush, with the
      tone of protestation. &ldquo;That is too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry to annoy you, but this information I am seeking is of
      such great importance&mdash;you understand&mdash;it&rsquo;s worth a
      consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, that&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; said Arkush. &ldquo;What will you give?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give twenty-five cents for each month that you go over&mdash;is it
      enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Yakub,&rdquo; cried Arkush. &ldquo;Run back from January 16th, and see if you
      find the name of Joseph White again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yakub carried the ledger to a desk hard by, and began his task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you smoke?&rdquo; Merivale asked the old man, offering him a cigar.
      Presently the air became blue with aromatic vapor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo; called Yakub from his stool. He proceeded to read aloud,
      &ldquo;&lsquo;December 7th&mdash;one onyx seal ring&mdash;amount, one dollar and a
      quarter&mdash;to Joseph White&mdash;residence, Leonard street&mdash;ticket-number,
      15,672. Same date&mdash;one ornamented wooden box&mdash;amount, fifteen
      cents&mdash;to Joseph White&mdash;residence, as above&mdash;ticket-number,
      15,67.&rsquo;.rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep still,&rdquo; said Merivale in an aside, as he saw my lips open. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do
      the talking.&mdash;I&rsquo;m infinitely obliged to you, Mr. Arkush. Now, if I
      may trespass just a little further upon your indulgence, can you tell me
      whether you still have either of those articles in stock? If so, I should
      be glad to see them&mdash;with a view to purchasing, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Yakub,&rdquo; said Arkush. &ldquo;Was those goods redeemed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yakub returned the ledger to the shelf whence he had taken it, and
      produced another book of similar proportions in its stead. Presently he
      said, &ldquo;Number 15,672, sold August 20, 18&mdash;; Number 15,673&mdash;see
      profit and loss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Number 15,672 was the ring, was it not?&rdquo; asked Merivale. &ldquo;Number 15,673
      is referred to the account of profit and loss&mdash;will you kindly turn
      to it under that head, Mr. Yakub?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yakub possessed himself of a third volume, and in due time read, &ldquo;&lsquo;Number
      15,673&mdash;July, 18&mdash;, given to R.&mdash;Amount of loss, fifteen
      cents.&rsquo;.rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see that entry,&rdquo; said Arkush.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had scrutinized it, &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I recollect. White
      was a colored man. I recollect all about it. That ring and that box were
      the first things he brought here; that picture was the last. I happen to
      recollect because I gave that box to my daughter, Rebecca, instead of
      offering it for sale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Merivale, &ldquo;then I suppose Miss Rebecca has it still. Could she
      be persuaded to show it to us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I will ask her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sent Yakub into the front room with instructions for Rebecca to present
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her arrival, they held a brief conference together in <i>Judisch</i>.
      Then Rebecca went away, and Arkush said to us, &ldquo;Yes, she has got it yet.
      She has gone to fetch it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During her absence Merivale resumed, &ldquo;You are quite sure that it is
      useless to go further back in your books&mdash;that the name of White
      doesn&rsquo;t occur in any other place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I am sure. I recollect perfectly. He was a colored man. He only
      came twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I notice that on one occasion his address is given as Harlem, on another
      as Leonard street. How is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know? Maybe he moved. Maybe neither address was his true one.
      These people very often give false names and addresses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they do,&rdquo; Merivale assented, and thereafter held his peace,
      chewing his nether lip as his habit was when engrossed in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my part I could not see that we had made much progress. I was
      beginning to get impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Becky reappeared, bearing the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      The box was about ten inches square by four or five in depth. It was
      empty. Merivale did not allow me to examine it. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said, as I
      reached out my hand to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you mind very much parting with this box, Miss Arkush?&rdquo; he asked,
      fixing a pair of languishing eyes upon Rebecca&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you give me for it?&rdquo; the business-like young lady inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you accept?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it worth, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That box is worth two dollars any how,&rdquo; replied the shameless old usurer,
      regardless of the fact that we knew to a mill what he had paid for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then certainly this will be enough,&rdquo; said Merivale, and he slipped a
      five-dollar gold piece into Rebecca&rsquo;s palm. Then he settled with Arkush,
      bestowed a gratuity upon Yakub, and bidding an affable good-by to every
      body, led me out through the shop into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we have run against the dead wall that you foresaw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it appears,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The picture was pawned by a colored man only two years ago&mdash;that is,
      four-and-twenty years after my father&rsquo;s death. We don&rsquo;t know of any means
      by which to reach that colored man; but even if we did&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a forlorn hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. So that we stand just as we did before we left home, do we not?
      Except that you are by five dollars a poorer man. It was sheer
      extravagance, your purchasing that box. I suppose your imagination
      connected it with <i>the</i> box&mdash;the box that Dr. Hirsch told me of.
      But the probabilities are overwhelmingly against that contingency. Then,
      why did you waste your money, buying it? Intrinsically, it isn&rsquo;t worth
      carrying away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush,&rdquo; interposed my friend. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me. I have an idea&mdash;an
      idea for a story&mdash;àpropos of Arkush and his daughter. Bless me with
      silence until I have meditated it to my soul&rsquo;s satisfaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At home he began, &ldquo;Yes, as you have said, our interview with Arkush was
      not fruitful. We have simply learned the name&mdash;or the assumed name&mdash;of
      the last owner of your father&rsquo;s picture&mdash;for, that it is your
      father&rsquo;s picture I have no sort of doubt. The next step would logically be
      to find Mr. White and question him. It is possible that a tempting
      advertisement in the newspaper might fetch him; but it is not probable.
      Very likely, he would never see it. Very likely, he is a thief, and even
      if he did see it, would be restrained by caution from replying to it. So
      that the outlook is not hopeful. As for this box being <i>the</i> box&mdash;why,
      the hypothesis is absurd. It was not on that supposition that I bought it.
      And even if it were <i>the</i> box, it would be of little consequence,
      empty as it is. I trust you are not too much disappointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means. I have managed to live for a considerable number of years in
      my present state of ignorance about my vanished legacy, and doubtless I
      shall pull through a few years more. Only, of course I was bound to follow
      the clew that this picture seemed to furnish, as far as it would lead; and
      having done so I am contented. I was not very hopeful when we started out,
      wherefore I am not very disappointed at the result. Let&rsquo;s think no more
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Your mind is imbued with a sound philosophy. But now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now, tell me why in the name of common sense you invested five
      dollars in that box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely what I was driving at. Now you are going to have a practical
      illustration of the value of experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the box up from the table where he had laid it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that &lsquo;intrinsically, this wasn&rsquo;t worth carrying away,&rsquo; and that
      my expenditure of half an eagle was a reckless waste of good material. To
      an inexperienced observer your view would certainly seem the correct one.
      The box is scarcely beautiful. The wood is oak. The metal with which its
      surface is so profusely ornamented looks like copper. The thing as a whole
      appears to have been designed for a cheapish jewel-case, now in the last
      stage of decrepitude. Do I express your sentiments?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eloquently and with precision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, my dear Lexow, are not a connoisseur. I, as chance would have
      it, have seen a box of this description before; saw one in France, the
      property of a lady of high degree; and, strange as it may seem, I don&rsquo;t
      believe a hundred bright gold pieces such as the one I gave Rebecca, could
      have induced my French lady friend to part with it. Guess why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Oh, I suppose it had certain associations that made her want to keep
      it. We often prize things quite irrespective of their market value. But go
      on: don&rsquo;t be so roundabout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the reason&mdash;at least one reason&mdash;for her setting such
      store by the box in question&mdash;which, I must remind you, was the very
      duplicate of the one we have here&mdash;the reason, I say, was that she
      knew enough about such matters to recognize that box for a specimen of
      cinque-cento&mdash;<i>a specimen of cinque-cento!</i> Now do you begin to
      realize that the paltry five dollars were not exorbitant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, from the standpoint of an antiquary, an amateur of bric-a-brac, I
      suppose it was not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent! No, sir; on the contrary, it was an immense bargain, a
      thorough-going stroke of luck. But now please take the box into your own
      hands, treat it gingerly, inspect it carefully, and tell me whether you
      remark any thing extraordinary about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, except that it is extraordinarily ugly and doesn&rsquo;t speak well
      for cinque-cento,&rdquo; I replied, after the requisite examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another proof that <i>das Sehen muss gelernt sein!</i> Here, I will
      enlighten you.&mdash;You behold this metal work which a moment since we
      disposed of as copper; learn that it is bronze; and not cast bronze,
      either, but wrought bronze, bronze shaped with hammer and chisel. Look
      closely at it; note the forms into which it has been modeled. See these
      roses, these lilies, these lotus leaves; see how exquisitely they are
      fashioned; see how they are massed together into a harmonious <i>ensemble</i>.
      Now hold it close to your eyes: see&mdash;do you see?&mdash;this serpent
      twined among the flowers! The artist must have worked from life&mdash;the
      very texture of the skin is reproduced&mdash;it makes one shudder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I admit it is a fine piece of work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we have not yet exhausted the list of its virtues by any means. Now
      open it and look at the interior.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see nothing remarkable about the interior,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;nothing but
      bare wood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all <i>you</i> see; but watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He applied the point of a pencil to one of the series of nail-heads with
      which the top of the lid was studded. It appeared to sink a hair&rsquo;s-breadth
      into the wood. Thereat the lower surface of the lid dropped down,
      disclosing a hollow space between it and the upper.&mdash;&ldquo;A double
      cover,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a place for hiding things and&mdash;hello! it isn&rsquo;t
      empty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, it wasn&rsquo;t empty. It contained a large, square envelope. Merivale
      hastily made a grab for it, and crossed over to the gas-fixture. &ldquo;Have we
      stumbled upon a romance?&rdquo; he cried. Holding it up to the light, presently
      he said: &ldquo;Come hither, Lexow. The writing is German script. I can&rsquo;t read
      it. Come and help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put the envelope into my hands. I ran my eyes over the writing. Next
      moment the envelope fluttered to the floor. I grasped Merivale&rsquo;s arm to
      support myself. My breath became short and quick. &ldquo;I was not prepared for
      this,&rdquo; I gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what? What is the trouble?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sank into a chair. Merivale picked up the envelope and studied it
      intently. &ldquo;I can make nothing out of it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to me&mdash;I will read it to you,&rdquo; I rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is what I read:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be delivered to my son, Ernest Neuman, upon his attaining the age of
      one-and-twenty years. Let there be no failure, as the will of a dying man
      is honored.&mdash;To my son: Open and read on your twenty-first birthday.
      Be alone when you read.&mdash;Your father, Ernest Neuman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither of us broke silence for some minutes afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;d better clear out,&rdquo; said Merivale. &ldquo;This is
      considerably more than we had bargained for. I suppose you&rsquo;d like to be
      alone. I&rsquo;ll remain in the next room. Call, if you want me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;I may as well read it at once. But do you know&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      quite natural, doubtless&mdash;I really dread opening it? Who can tell
      what its contents may be? Who can tell what information it may convey, to
      the detriment of that ignorance which is bliss? Who can tell what duty it
      may impose&mdash;what change it may make necessary in my mode of life? I&mdash;I
      am really afraid of it. The superscription is not reassuring&mdash;and
      then, this strange accident by which it has reached its destination after
      so many years! It is like a fatality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is inevitable that you should feel this way. The suddenness of the
      business was enough to shatter your self-possession. At the same time you
      would best not delay about reading it. You won&rsquo;t be able to rest until
      you&rsquo;ve done so, you know.&mdash;Yes, indeed, it is like a fatality&mdash;like
      an incident in a novel&mdash;one of those happenings that we never expect
      to see occur in real life. I&rsquo;ll wait in the next room till you call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My heart stood still as I broke the seal. Four double sheets of thin
      glazed paper, covered with minute German script. The ink was faded, and
      there were a good many blots and interlineations; so that it was only by
      dint of straining my eyesight to the utmost that I could decipher my
      father&rsquo;s message. But screwing up my courage, I attacked it, nor did I
      pause till I had read the last word.

    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a little less than two years old; I, your father, am dying. I
      shall be dead before your birthday. That will be the 6th <i>Cheshvan</i>.
      It is now the 2nd <i>Ellul</i> The physician gives me till some time in <i>Tishri</i>
      to keep possession of my faculties. I am dying before my time. I have
      something yet to accomplish in this world. <img src="images/god.jpg" alt="" />
      has willed that it be accomplished. He has willed that you accomplish it
      in my stead. I am in my bed as I write this, in the bed from which I shall
      not rise again. Through the open door of my room I can hear you crowing in
      your nurse&rsquo;s arms. Ah, would that you could understand by word of mouth
      from me now, what I am compelled to write. There is so much that a man can
      not but forget to put down, when he is writing. Yet <img

      trembling fingers. It will not allow me to forget any thing that is
      essential. When this is completed, I shall put it into safe hands, that it
      may be delivered to you at the proper time. I have no fear. I am sure it
      will reach you. It will reach you sooner or later, though all men conspire
      to the contrary. <img src="images/god.jpg" alt="" /> has promised it. He

      fulfillment of this errand of justice with which I charge you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have prayed. I also have laid aside my pen for a moment, and,
      summoning your nurse to bring you to my bedside, have prayed with my hand

      lustrous depths of her eyes. Ah, my son, you little guess how much you
      lost when you lost your mother. But you must learn the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother was younger than I by seven years. I am thirty. Your mother
      would be three-and-twenty had she lived. She was nineteen when I married
      her. It was in Savannah, Georgia, going on five years ago. Ah, my Ernest,
      I can not tell you how beautiful your mother appeared to me when I saw her
      first. I can not tell you with what great love I loved her. Suppose that
      you had never seen a stone more precious than a pebble such as may be
      picked up in our back garden, and that all at once a diamond were shown to
      you, a diamond of the purest water: would you not distrust your eyes,
      crying, &lsquo;Ah, so fine, so wonderful! Can it be?&mdash;So was it when I saw
      your mother. I had seen pebbles innumerable, ay, and mock diamonds too.
      She was the first true diamond I had ever seen. I loved her at the first
      glance.&mdash;How long, after the sun has risen, does it take the waters
      of the earth to sparkle with the sunlight? So long it took my heart to
      love, after my eyes for the first time had met your mother&rsquo;s. But how much
      I loved her, how every drop of my life was sucked up and absorbed into my
      love of her, it would be useless for me to try to make you understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, loving her as I did, I hesitated to bespeak her for my wife.
      Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my eighteenth year my own father&mdash;your grandfather, of holy
      memory&mdash;had died. On his death-bed he called me to him. He said:
      &lsquo;When you have become a man you will meet many women. To one of them your
      heart will go out in love. You will desire her for your wife. But I say to
      you here on my death-bed, beware! Do not marry, though your love be
      greater than your life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In the fourth generation back of me our ancestor was betrayed by the
      wife of his choice. So great was his hatred of her on this account, that
      he wished his seed, contaminated as it was by having taken root in her
      womb, to become extinct. Therefore he forbade his son to marry. And to
      this prohibition he attached a penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, in defiance of his wish, his son should take unto himself a woman,
      then should he too taste the bitterness of infidelity within the
      household, then should he too be betrayed and dishonored by his wife. And
      this penalty he made to extend to the seventh and eighth generations.
      Whosoever of his progeny should enter into the wedded state should enter
      by the same step into the antechamber of hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But his son laughed as he listened; and within two years he was married.
      But within two years also the laughter froze upon his lips. For behold,
      the curse of his father had come to pass!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Thus ever since. Each of our ancestors, despite his father&rsquo;s caution,
      has taken a wife. He has been betrayed and dishonored by her even as I
      have been betrayed and dishonored by your mother. He has repeated to his
      own son the family malediction even as I am now repeating it to you.&mdash;Let
      that malediction then go down into the grave with me. Do not marry, as you
      wish for peace now and hereafter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in this wise that on his death-bed my father had spoken to me. I
      remembered his words when I found that I had begun to love a woman. It was
      for this reason that I hesitated to ask your mother to become my wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but, my son, of what avail is hesitation at such a moment?&mdash;when
      you are gazing into the eyes of the woman you love? With sails set and a
      strong wind behind it, can the ship hesitate to speed across the sea?
      Thrust into a bed of live coals, can the wood hesitate to kindle and burn?
      With the sun beating hot upon the earth above it, can the seed hesitate to
      sprout and send forth rootlets? How long then could I, with the light of
      your mother&rsquo;s face shining upon my pathway, how long could I hesitate to
      say, &lsquo;I love you. Be my wife&rsquo;.&mdash;We were married.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, my son, will never know how happy it is possible for a man to be. A
      woman such as your mother is born only once in all time. You will never
      meet with her like. You will never know the supreme joy of having her for
      your wife. Her breath was sweeter than the fragrance of the sweetest
      flower. The song of the nightingale was less musical than her simplest
      word. All the light of heaven was eclipsed by the light that glowed far
      down in her eyes. Her presence at my side was a foretaste of paradise.
      Only to take her hand into my own and stroke its warm, satiny skin, was an
      ecstasy which I can not describe, which I can not remember even at this
      extreme moment without a quickening of the pulse. For three, yes, for four
      years after our marriage we were so happy that we cried each morning and
      each evening at our prayers, &lsquo;Lord, what have we done to merit such
      happiness?&rsquo;&mdash;I, my son, laughed as I recalled the dying words of my
      father. &lsquo;The family curse in my case,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;has gone astray. I have no
      fear.&rsquo;&mdash;Alas! I took too much for granted. I congratulated myself too
      soon. Our happiness was doomed to be burst like a bubble at a touch. The
      family curse had perhaps gone astray for a little while: it was bound to
      find its way back before the end. The will of our ancestor could not be
      thwarted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first three years of our married life we passed at Savannah, dwelling
      with the parents of your mother. There you were born&mdash;as it seemed,
      in order to consummate and seal with the seal of <img src="images/god.jpg" alt="" />  our
      perfect joy. Then, when you were still but three months old, it became
      necessary that I should return and take up my residence again in New York.
      We were not sorry to come to New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicholas had been my closest friend for many years. Boys together at
      Breslau, we had crossed the sea together, and had started our new life
      together here in America. Before our wedding I had described Nicholas to
      your mother, saying, &lsquo;Him also must you love;&rsquo; and to Nicholas I had
      written, bidding him include my wife in his love of me.&mdash;This was why
      we were not sorry to leave Savannah and come to New York: because Nicholas
      was here, because we wanted to be near to our best friend.&mdash;Nicholas
      met us as we disembarked from the sailing vessel that had brought us
      hither. It made my heart warm to greet my old comrade and to present to
      him my wife and my son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a true friend to Nicholas. After your mother and you, he was first
      in my heart. I would have shared with him my last drop of water, my last
      crumb of bread; and he, I believed, would have done the same by me. My
      purse was always open for Nicholas to put in his hand and take out what he
      would, even to the last penny. I thought Nicholas was pure gold. I trusted
      him as I trusted myself. I said to your mother, &lsquo;No evil can betide you so
      long as Nicholas is alive. If any thing should happen to me, in him you
      will have a brother, in him our Ernest will have a second father.&rsquo; It gave
      me a sense of perfect security, made me feel that the strength of my own
      right arm was doubled, the fact that Nicholas was my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. After my return to New York the intimacy between Nicholas and
      myself increased. He was constantly at our house. We were always glad to
      see him. A place was always laid for him at our table; it made our hearts
      light to have him with us, so bright, so gay, withal so good, so sterling,
      such a trusty friend was he. I delighted to witness the friendship that
      rapidly sprang up between your mother and Nicholas. He entertained her,
      told her stories, made her laugh.&mdash;She would often exclaim, &lsquo;Dear,
      good Nicholas! What should we do without him?&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;That is right.
      Let him be next to your son and your husband in your affection.&rsquo; I do not
      think it is common for one man to love another as I loved Nicholas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But after we had been in New York a little more than two months, your
      mother&rsquo;s manner toward Nicholas began to change. She was cold and formal
      to him; when he would arrive, instead of running up with outstretched
      hands and crying, &lsquo;Ah, it is you!&rsquo; she would courtesy to him and say
      without smiling, &lsquo;How do you do?&rsquo;&mdash;She laughed no more at his
      stories, she appeared to avoid him when she could; when she could not, she
      was silent and morose. I could see no reason for this. I was pained. I
      said, &lsquo;Bertha, why do you behave so toward our best friend?&rsquo; Your mother
      pretended not to understand. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t deny it,&rsquo; I insisted. &lsquo;You are as
      distant, as polite to him, as if he were a mere acquaintance.&rsquo; Your mother
      answered, &lsquo;I am sorry to distress you. I don&rsquo;t know what you mean. I was
      not aware that I had been discourteous to your friend.&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;Has
      Nicholas done any thing?&rsquo; I asked.&mdash;&rsquo;No, he has done nothing.&rsquo;&mdash;I
      blamed your mother severely. I besought her to subdue what I took for her
      caprice. Yet every day her conduct toward Nicholas grew colder and more
      formal. Every day I reproved her more and more earnestly. This was the
      nearest approach to a quarrel that your mother and I had ever had. It
      grieved me deeply that she should adopt such a manner toward my friend. I
      was all the more cordial to him in consequence. I hoped that he would not
      notice the turn affairs had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus till almost a year ago. You lacked but a fortnight of being one year
      old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business had kept me down town till late. At last I made up my mind that
      I should not be able to go home at all that night. So I told Nicholas to
      visit Bertha and let her know. &lsquo;Spend the evening with her,&rsquo; I said.
      &lsquo;Explain how it is that I am compelled to remain here. Tell her that I
      will come home to breakfast. Be sure to entertain her. I don&rsquo;t want to
      think of her as lonesome.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next morning I hurried home. I stole softly into the house, to surprise
      your mother. Ah, my son, my son, I need not give you the details.&mdash;The
      house was empty. There was a brief letter from your mother. As I read it,
      my head swam, a mortal weakness overpowered me, I sank in a swoon upon the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I recovered from my swoon, I was lying undressed in bed. There were
      people round about. I remembered every thing. What! I was lying idle in
      bed, and Nicholas still alive? I started up to be upon his track. I fell
      back, impotent. &lsquo;What has befallen me?&rsquo; I asked. I was informed that I had
      had a hemorrhage of the lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need not tell you what I suffered. My suffering was great in proportion
      to my love. The shame, the disgrace, were nothing. But at one blow to be
      deprived of wife, child, friend; to have my love and my faith and my
      happiness shattered at one stroke: it was too much. Yet, let this be
      impressed upon you, that not for one instant did I blame your mother. I
      realized that she, like myself, was but the helpless victim of the family
      curse. It was my fault. I had defied the inevitable. The keenest agony of
      all was to lie there, unable to rise, and think of Nicholas. Ah, a
      thousand times in imagination I tore his heart bleeding from his breast! I
      hated him now, as much as I had formerly cherished him. And yet, I believe
      I could in the end have forgiven him, if&mdash;ah, but of what use to say,
      &lsquo;If&rsquo;. Listen to the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a short four months afterward&mdash;four months that had seemed,
      however, a thousand years to me&mdash;and I still lay here dead in life,
      when the good Dr. Hirsch, (to whom now in my dying hours I commend you, my
      son), came to my bedside and said that he had seen your mother. He
      believed that if I would take her back, she would be glad. If I would take
      her back! &lsquo;Bring her to me,&rsquo; I cried. And I thanked <img src="images/god.jpg" alt="" />
      for this manifestation of his mercy. &lsquo;You must prepare for a sad change in
      her,&rsquo; said Dr. Hirsch.&mdash;&rsquo;Bring her, bring her,&rsquo; I cried impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even to you, my son, can I reveal the secret of that first hour, of
      that deep hour, when your mother sat again at my side and received my
      pardon&mdash;nay, not my pardon, for it was her place to pardon me. If
      before that it had been possible for me to forgive Nicholas, it was so no
      longer. For your mother&rsquo;s face was deathly pale, her cheek hollow, her eye
      bright with fever. Nicholas had&mdash;what? Petted her for a month; for a
      month, ignored her; for another month, ill treated her; in the end,
      abandoned her, it might be to starve. Nicholas had done this Nicholas whom
      I had loved and trusted. As I saw your mother pine away, grow paler and
      more feeble beneath my sight, my hatred of that man intensified. On the
      day your mother died, I promised her that I would get well and live and
      force him to atone for his offense in blood. My great hatred seemed to
      endow me with strength. I believed that <img src="images/god.jpg" alt="" />
      would not let me die until I had once again met Nicholas face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this delusion was short-lived. A second hemorrhage threw me back,
      weaker than ever, upon my bed. The physician told me that I had absolutely
      no ground for hope. It was evident that <img src="images/god.jpg" alt="" />
      had willed that the chastisement of my enemy should not be wrought out by
      my hand. &lsquo;But&rsquo; is just,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;He will not allow a crime like this to
      go unavenged.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was then that my thought turned to you. And all this time, what of
      you? You too were lying at the point of death. Of you too the physician
      said, &lsquo;He can not survive the winter.&rsquo; You, my single hope, threatened at
      any moment to breathe your last. &lsquo;But no,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;it shall not be so.
      My Ernest must live. As <img src="images/god.jpg" alt="" /> is both just
      and merciful, Ernest will live.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I watched the fluctuations of your illness, divided between hope and
      fear, between faith in the goodness of <img src="images/god.jpg" alt="" />
      and doubt lest the worst might come to pass. Ah, that was a breathless
      period. Day after day passed by, and there was no certainty. Constantly
      the doctor said, &lsquo;Death is merely a question of a few days, more or less.&rsquo;
      Constantly my heart replied, &lsquo;No, no, he will not die.&rdquo; has decreed that
      he shall live.&rsquo; I prayed that your life might be spared, morning, noon,
      and night. My own strength was ebbing away. But that was of little matter.
      I wanted to hold out only until I should know for good and all whether my
      son was to survive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed be the name of <img src="images/god.jpg" alt="" /> forever! At the
      moment when the physician said, &lsquo;He will die within an hour,&rsquo; lo! the God
      of our fathers touched your body with his healing wand. There was a change
      for the better. The physician himself could not deny it. He maintained
      that it was but transitory. &lsquo;Nothing short of a miracle,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;can
      save this baby&rsquo;s life.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We will see,&rsquo; said I aloud. To myself I said, &lsquo;The miracle has been
      performed.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was right. Two days later the physician confessed that your chances of
      recovery were good. Two days later still you were out of danger. <img
      src="images/god.jpg" alt="" /> had heard my prayers. The God of Israel is a
      righteous God! Oh, for the tongue of the prophets to sing a sufficient
      song of thanksgiving to <img src="images/god.jpg" alt="" />. He has
      snatched you from the clutch of death for a purpose. He will see to it
      that you fulfill that purpose, though your heart be burned to ashes in the
      task. He will make you to be great like Ephraim and Manasseh. (<i>Y si me
      ha Elohim k&rsquo;.phraim v&rsquo;chi Manasseh!</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again I have summoned your nurse, to bring you to my bedside. Again I
      have laid down my pen, to place my hand upon your head and bless you in
      the name of Again, before reading further, pause for a space and pray that
      the breath of God may make strong your heart.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;My son, I allow you one-and-twenty years to become a man, one-and-twenty
      years to gain strength of arm and firmness of will. I allow you
      one-and-twenty years of youth, one-and-twenty years in which to enjoy
      life, free of care. On your twenty-first birthday, if the good and
      reverend Dr. Hirsch live, he will put this writing into your hands. Should
      he be dead, others will see that you receive it. On your twenty-first
      birthday you will be a boy no longer. You will recognize yourself for a
      man. You will ask, &lsquo;What is to be the aim, the occupation of my life?&rsquo; You
      will read this writing, and your question will be answered. Your father on
      the brink of the grave pauses to speak to you as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of <img src="images/god.jpg" alt="" />, who in response to my
      prayers has saved your life, who created you out of the dust and the
      ashes, who tore you from the embrace of death and restored health to your
      shattered body for one sole purpose, in Ins name I charge you: Find my
      enemy out and put him to death. He is still a young man. He will scarcely
      be an old man when you have become of age. It is a long time to wait, a
      long time to defer my vengeance, one-and-twenty years, but so I believe
      <img src="images/god.jpg" alt="" /> has willed it. After you have reached
      the age of one-and-twenty years, let that be the single motive and object
      of your days: to find him out and put him to death by the most painful
      mode of death you can devise. Do not strike him down with one blow.
      Torture him to death. Pluck his flesh from his bones shred by shred.
      Prolong his agony to the utmost. Thus shall you compensate in some measure
      for the one-and-twenty years of delay. And again and again as he is
      writhing under your heel, cry out to him, &lsquo;Remember, remember the friend
      who loved you and whom you betrayed, whose honey you turned to gall and
      wormwood.&rsquo; But, if meanwhile from other causes death should have overtaken
      him, then shall you transfer your anger to his next-of-kin; then, I charge
      you, visit the penalty of his sin upon his children and his children&rsquo;s
      children. For has not <img src="images/god.jpg" alt="" /> decreed that the
      sins of the fathers shall be visited upon the children even unto the third
      and fourth generations? The blood of Nicholas must be spilled, whether it
      courses in his veins or in the veins of his posterity. The race of
      Nicholas must be exterminated, obliterated from the face of the earth. As
      you honor the wish of a dying father, as you dread the wrath of <img
      src="images/god.jpg" alt="" />, falter not in this that I command. Search
      the four corners of the world until you have unearthed my enemy or his
      kindred. Empty his blood upon the sand as you would the blood of swine.
      And think, as he is calling out to you for mercy, think, &lsquo;At last my
      father&rsquo;s revenge is wreaked! At last my father&rsquo;s spirit can rest content.
      Even now my father is in transports of delight as he witnesses this
      fruition of his hope. At each thrust of my knife into our enemy&rsquo;s flesh,
      the heart of my father leaps with satisfaction. At each scream of pain
      that escapes from our enemy&rsquo;s throat, the voice of my father waxes great
      with joy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my son, at that mighty hour, whether I be confined in the bottom
      fastnesses of hell or exalted to the mountain tops of paradise, I shall
      know what is happening, I shall fling myself upon my face and sing a song
      of praise to <img src="images/god.jpg" alt="" />  for the unspeakable rapture which he has
      permitted me to enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son, I trust you. You will not falter. You will remember that <img
      src="images/god.jpg" alt="" /> has saved you from death for this solitary
      purpose, that you have no right to your own life except as you employ it
      for the chastisement of my foe. I have no fear. You will hate him with a
      hatred equal to my own. You will wreak that hatred as I should have
      wreaked it, had my life been spared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no fear, no distrust, and yet&mdash;all things are possible. My
      son, I warn you. In case you be faint-hearted, in case you recoil from
      this mission you are charged with, or in case by any accident&mdash;though
      <img src="images/god.jpg" alt="" /> will allow no such accident to happen&mdash;in
      case by any accident this writing should fail to reach you, I shall be
      prepared. From my grave I shall watch over you. From my grave I shall
      guide you. From my grave I shall see to it that you do not neglect the
      duty of your life. Though seas roll between you and him, I shall see to it
      that you two meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though your heart be bound to him as to your own flesh and blood, I shall
      see to it that you swerve not. And if he be dead, I shall see to it that
      you are brought face to face with his kindred. Man, woman, or child, spare
      neither. Young or old, able or feeble-bodied, let it matter not. In case
      your strength desert you, in case your courage weaken, I shall be at your
      side, I shall nerve your arm. If you hesitate, remember that my spirit
      will possess your body and do what must be done in spite of your
      hesitation. There will be no escape for you. As certainly as the moon must
      follow the earth, so certainly will and must you, my son, accomplish the
      purpose for which your life is given.&mdash;But falter not, as you cherish
      the fair name of your mother, as you honor the desire, as you fear the
      curse, of a dying father, as you hope for peace for your own soul.

      &ldquo;I have written the above during my moments of strength for the last four
      days. Now I have just read it over. I find that it but feebly expresses
      all that I mean and feel. But <img src="images/god.jpg" alt="" /> will
      enlighten you as you read. It is enough. I find also that I have omitted
      to mention his full name. His name is Nicholas Pathzuol.&rdquo;

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE emotions that
      grew upon me, as I read my father&rsquo;s message, need not be detailed. How, as
      I painfully deciphered it, word following upon word added steadily to the
      weight of those emotions, until at length it seemed as though the burden
      was greater than I could bear, I need not tell. Indeed, so engrossed had I
      become by what had gone before, that the sense of the last line did not
      penetrate my mind. I leaned back in my chair and drew a long breath like
      one exhausted by an effort beyond his strength. I waited for the commotion
      of thought and feeling to quiet a little. I was completely horror-stricken
      and tired out and bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by and by it occurred to me, &ldquo;What did he say the man&rsquo;s name was?&rdquo; And
      languidly I picked up the paper and read the postscript for a second time.
      The next instant I was on my feet, rigid, aghast, for consternation. What!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pathzuol! The name of Veronika! My head swam. It was as if I had sustained
      a terrific blow between the eyes. Could it be that this Pathzuol, the man
      who had dishonored my mother, the man whom my father had commissioned me
      to murder, was <i>her father?</i> the father of her who had indeed been
      murdered, and of whose murder I had been accused? The mere possibility
      stunned and sickened me. It was the straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back. I
      had been under a pretty tense nervous strain ever since the reception of
      Tikulski&rsquo;s letter in the afternoon. This last utterly undid me. My muscles
      relaxed, my knees knocked together, the perspiration trickled down my
      forehead. I went off into a regular fit of weeping, like a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long before Merivale entered. I looked up and saw him standing
      over me, with a physiognomy divided between astonishment and contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Lexow,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head, &ldquo;I am surprised at you.&rdquo; Then his
      eyes grew stern, and he continued sharply, &ldquo;Stop! Stop your crying. You
      ought to be ashamed. Whatever new misfortune has befallen you, you have no
      right to act like this. It is a man&rsquo;s part to bear misfortune silently. It
      is a school-girl&rsquo;s or a baby&rsquo;s to take on in this fashion. Stop your
      crying, dry your eyes, and show what you are made of. Grit your teeth and
      clench your fists and don&rsquo;t open your mouth till you are ready to behave
      like a reasonable being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His words sobered me to some extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am calm now. What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I should do what <i>I</i> want,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;you would not speedily
      forget it. I should&mdash;but never mind that. What I want <i>you</i> to
      do is to speak up like a man and explain the occasion of this rumpus, if
      you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, read this,&rdquo; I said, offering him the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it, glanced at it, turned it this way and that, handed it back.
      &ldquo;How can I read it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s German. Read it to me.&mdash;Come,
      read it to me,&rdquo; he repeated, as I hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gulped down my reluctance and read the whole thing through as rapidly as
      I could in English. He sat across the table, smoking and drawing figures
      in the ash-pan with the ashes of his cigarette. Once in a while I heard
      him whistle softly to himself. He had thrown his last cigarette aside and
      was biting his fingernails when the reading drew to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that enough?&rdquo; I rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean that. Oh, yes; that&rsquo;s enough; and it&rsquo;s pretty bad too.
      But I expected something worse from the rough way you cut up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse? In heaven&rsquo;s name what could be worse? My mother dishonored, my
      father broken hearted, and I marked out for a murderer, even from my
      cradle? And then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say it&rsquo;s hard, deucedly hard. But inasmuch as you&rsquo;re not a murderer,
      you know, I wouldn&rsquo;t let that side of the matter bother me, if I were you.
      The bad part of the business is to think of how your father&rsquo;s happiness,
      your mother&rsquo;s innocence, were destroyed. Think how he must have suffered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t listened, you haven&rsquo;t understood the worst, yet. Here,
      see his name&mdash;Pathzuol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you remember? It is the same name as hers&mdash;Veronika&rsquo;s&mdash;my
      sweetheart&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly!&rdquo; exclaimed Merivale. &ldquo;That is a startling coincidence, I
      admit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couple that with&mdash;with the rest of my father&rsquo;s story and with&mdash;with
      the&mdash;well, with all the facts&mdash;and I think you&rsquo;ll confess that
      it was sufficient to shake me up a bit. To come upon that name at the end
      of such a letter, it was like being knocked down. I lost my
      self-possession. Think! if he <i>was</i> her father! But, oh no; it isn&rsquo;t
      credible. It&rsquo;s sheer accident, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is. The letter doesn&rsquo;t say that he was even married. I
      suppose there&rsquo;s more than one Pathzuol in the world as well as more than
      one Merivale. But all the same, it&rsquo;s a coincidence of a sort to stir a
      fellow up. I don&rsquo;t wonder you lost your balance. Only, the idea of
      boohooing like a woman! That&rsquo;s inexcusable. Mercy! what a good hater your
      father was! And what an unspeakable wretch, Nicholas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;it gave me a pretty severe jolt, the sight of that
      name; and I can&rsquo;t seem to get over it. I don&rsquo;t know why, but I can&rsquo;t help
      feeling as though there were more in this than either you or I perceive,
      as though there were some deduction or other to be drawn from it which is
      right within arm&rsquo;s reach and yet which I can&rsquo;t grasp&mdash;some horrible
      corollary, you know. My brain is in a whirl, I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite unstrung, as it is natural you should be. But you must
      exert your reason and put the stopper upon your imagination. Let
      deductions and corollaries take care of themselves. Confine yourself to
      the facts, and you&rsquo;ll see that they&rsquo;re not as bad as they might be, after
      all. For example&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is just the facts that perplex and horrify me. My father destines
      me to be the murderer of Nicholas Pathzuol or of his next of kin. All
      ignorant of this destiny, I meet and love a lady whose name is Pathzuol&mdash;a
      name so rare that I had never heard it before, and have not since, except
      in this writing to-day. My lady is murdered; and I, though innocent, am
      suspected and accused of the crime. Add to this my father&rsquo;s threat to come
      back from the grave and use me as his instrument, in case I hesitate or in
      case I never receive his letter; and&mdash;well, it is like a problem in
      mathematics&mdash;given this and that, to determine so and so. No, no,
      there&rsquo;s no use denying it, this strange combination of facts must have
      some awful meaning. It seems as though each minute I was just on the point
      of catching it, and then as I tighten my fingers around it, it escapes
      again and eludes me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, man. You are yielding to your fancy, like a child who, because
      he feels oppressed in the dark, conjures up ghosts and goblins, and can
      not be persuaded that there are none about, till you light the gas and
      show him that the room is empty. Come, light the gas of your common sense!
      Recognize that your problem has no solution, none because it is not a true
      problem, but merely a fortuitous arrangement of circumstances which
      chances to bear a superficial resemblance to one. Reduce your <i>quasi</i>
      problem to its simplest terms: thus, given x and y and z, to find the
      value of b. Don&rsquo;t you see that there&rsquo;s no connection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course, I acknowledge that I can&rsquo;t <i>see</i> any connection.
      That&rsquo;s just the trouble. I <i>feel</i> that there must be a connection&mdash;one
      that I can&rsquo;t see. If I could only see it, it wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad. But this
      perplexity, this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This fiddle-stick! You are resolved to distress yourself, and I suppose
      it&rsquo;s useless for me to labor with you. Only this much I will say, that if
      you should bestow a little of the energy you are expending in the effort
      to catch hold of a non-existent inference, upon sympathy with your
      father&rsquo;s unhappiness, I should have more respect for you. They talk about
      suffering ennobling and chastening men, forsooth! So far as you are
      concerned, suffering has done nothing but intensify your natural egotism.
      For instance, after reading that letter of your father&rsquo;s, the first idea
      that strikes you is, &lsquo;How does it affect <i>me</i>, how am <i>I</i>
      concerned by it?&rsquo; whereas the spectacle of your father s immense grief
      ought to have absorbed you to the exclusion of every thing else, ought to
      have left no room in your mind for any other thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But for all Merivale could say by way either of appeal or of reprimand, I
      was powerless to subdue that feeling which had begun to stir in my breast.
      I recognized that I was unreasonable and selfish, but I was also helpless.
      I could not get over the shock I had sustained when Pathzuol&rsquo;s name first
      took shape before my eyes. Every time I remembered that moment&mdash;and
      it kept recurring to me in spite of myself&mdash;my heart sank and my
      breath became spasmodic, as if I had been confronted by a ghost. And then
      ensued that sensation of groping in the dark after something invisible,
      unknown, yet surely there, hovering within arm&rsquo;s reach, but as elusive as
      a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp. I struggled with this sensation, tried my utmost to
      shake it off, but it sat like a monster on my heart. Its weight was
      deadly, its touch was icy; it would not be dislodged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, all that you say, Merivale,&rdquo; I returned at length. &ldquo;But the
      question is not one of what I ought to do; it is one of what I can do. I
      know I ought to regard this matter in the same collected spirit that you
      display; but it concerns me so intimately, you see, that I can&rsquo;t resist
      being somewhat perturbed. My wits, so to speak, have been scattered by an
      unexpected blow. I shan&rsquo;t be able to emulate your <i>sang-froid</i> until
      they have got back to their proper places. I&rsquo;m so heated and upset that I
      don&rsquo;t really know what I think or what I feel. I guess perhaps I&rsquo;d better
      go for a walk and cool off, and arrive at an understanding with myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very worst thing you could possibly do&mdash;go away by yourself and
      brood and get more and more morbid every minute. What you want is to think
      of something else for a while, and then when you come back to this subject
      you&rsquo;ll be in a condition to regard it in its correct light. Let&rsquo;s&mdash;let&rsquo;s
      play a game of cribbage, or read some Rossetti; or suppose you fiddle a
      little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I feel the need of air and exercise. I&rsquo;ll go out and take a walk. I
      sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;. brood, I&rsquo;ll reflect on the sensible things you&rsquo;ve said. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I walked briskly through the streets, striving to collect my faculties,
      striving to regain sufficient mental tranquillity to comprehend exactly
      what the long and short of the whole business was. But the feeling that
      there was something more in it than I could make out, intensified. It
      would not be dispelled. The oftener I went over the circumstances, the
      more significant they seemed.&mdash;Significant of what? Precisely the
      question that I could not answer. The longer I allowed my mind to dwell
      upon them, the more acute became that sensation of wrestling with a
      problem, of groping for a something suspended near to me in the dark. My
      father had destined me to be a murderer; the name of my intended victim
      was Pathzuol; I had been engaged to a young lady of the same name, very
      possibly the daughter of my father&rsquo;s foe; she had indeed been murdered,
      though not by my hand; and yet I, despite my innocence, had been deemed
      guilty of the crime: this chain of facts kept passing over and over before
      me. I felt that it must mean something; it could not be purely fortuitous;
      there was a break, a missing link, which, if I could but supply it, would
      make the hidden meaning clear. I walked the streets all night, unable to
      fix my thoughts on any thing else. I said, &ldquo;You are merely wearing
      yourself out and getting your brains into a tangle: try to divert your
      attention. Count up to a thousand. See how much you can remember of the
      Moonlight Sonata. Conjugate a Hebrew verb. Do what you will, only stop
      puzzling over this matter. As Merivale says, when you have thought of
      something else for a while, you will be in a condition to return to it
      with refreshed intelligence, and view it in the right light.&rdquo; But the next
      moment I was at it again, in greater perplexity than ever. Of course, I
      succeeded in working myself up to a high degree of nervousness: was as
      exhausted and as exasperated as though I had spent an hour in futile
      attempts to thread a needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now it began to get light. The stillness of the night was broken, my
      solitude was disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hosts of sparrows began to congregate upon the window sills, and their
      busy twittering filled the air. First one steam-whistle blew in the
      distance, then another nearer by, then another, and finally a chorus of
      them: bells began to ring, wagons rattled over the pavement, the shrill
      whoo-hoop of the milk-man resounded through the streets. The clatter of
      footsteps became audible upon the sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      People began to walk abroad. The sky turned from black to gray, from gray
      to blue. Shutters were banged, doors slammed, windows thrown open:
      housemaids with brooms and buckets appeared upon the stoops. Dawn had
      arrived from across the Ocean with the smell of the sea-breeze still
      clinging to her skirts. The city was waking to its feverish multifarious
      life.&mdash;And the result was that I forgot myself&mdash;was penetrated
      and exalted by that vague tremulous exhilaration which always accompanies
      the first breath of morning. I expanded my lungs and inhaled the fresh air
      and felt a glow of warmth and animation shoot through my limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;a truce to the blue devils! I will go home and take up my
      regular life again, just as though this interruption had not occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hurried back to our lodgings. Merivale was already up and dressed,
      smoking a cigarette over the newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hail!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;I am glad to see you out of bed so early!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not been abed since you left,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? What have you been doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking about you&mdash;about what can be done to make a man of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t worry about that. I&rsquo;m all right now. I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;. play the
      fool again, I promise you. I propose that we sink the last four-and-twenty
      hours into eternal oblivion. What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing would more delight me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Let&rsquo;s begin at the first cause. Where&rsquo;s the manuscript? We&rsquo;ll set
      fire to it, and agree to believe that it never really existed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Merivale, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t set fire to it&mdash;at least not till it
      is manifest whether your present mood is merely a reaction from your late
      one, or whether it is going to last. I will dispose of the manuscript&mdash;see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found it on the table, opened the double cover of the box, restored the
      papers to the place they had occupied formerly, and locked the box up in
      the closet of his writing-desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the best thing to do. I&rsquo;ll take care of it. Some
      day you may have a little sympathy to waste on your father, and then
      you&rsquo;ll be glad this writing was not destroyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had breakfast, and after the cups and saucers were cleared away,
      applied ourselves to our ordinary forenoon occupation. It turned out
      indeed that my good spirits were, as Merivale had suspected, to some
      extent reactionary: but they left me sober rather than sad. I was
      absent-minded and committed numberless blunders while my friend dictated
      his poems: but I did not let my thoughts settle down again upon the
      matters that had engaged them during the night. They simply wandered about
      in a random way from one indifferent topic to another, as it is the habit
      of thoughts to do when the thinker has not had his customary allotment of
      sleep. Presently Merivale suspended his dictation, and I waited passively
      for him to resume, supposing that he had reached a point where reflection
      was necessary to further progress. His silence continued. Pretty soon my
      eyelids dropped like leaden curtains over my eyes, and my chin sank upon
      my breast. I was actually nodding. I started up and pinched myself,
      ashamed of appearing drowsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lo! I perceived that my friend had met with the same mishap. He too was
      nodding in his chair. For a moment we eyed each other sheepishly, each
      endeavoring to feign wide wakefulness. Then Merivale rose and stretched
      himself and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part I cast off the mask,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I am sleepy and I am going
      to bed. You&rsquo;d better follow suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I needed no urging. We retired to our dormitory, and as speedily as was
      practicable one of us at least fell into an unfathomable slumber.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> DON&rsquo;. know how
      many hours afterward I awoke. Gradually, as consciousness asserted itself,
      I realized that somebody was playing a violin in the adjacent room: and at
      length it struck me that it must be Merivale practicing. I pricked up my
      ears and hearkened. Oh, yes; he was running over his part of the last new
      composition we had studied. The clock-like tick-tack of his metronome
      marked the rhythm. I lay still and listened till he had repeated the same
      phrase some twenty times. Finally I got up and crossed the threshold that
      divided us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Merivale kept on playing for a minute or two, unaware of my intrusion. Not
      till it behooved him to turn the page did he lift his eyes. Then,
      encountering my night-robed figure,they lighted up with merriment. Their
      owner lowered his instrument, remained silent for a moment, in the end
      gave vent to an uproarious peal of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; I stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had got his hilarity somewhat under control he replied: &ldquo;At you.
      Come and gaze upon yourself.&rdquo; And conducting me to a mirror he said,
      pointing, &ldquo;There, isn&rsquo;t that a funny sight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked sleepy, that was all. My hair was awry, and my eyes were heavy,
      and my costume was a trifle wrinkled. Still, I suppose, my general
      appearance was sufficiently ludicrous. Be that as it may, I could not help
      joining in Merivale&rsquo;s laughter: and, thus put into good humor at the
      outset, I cheerfully complied with his request to hasten through my toilet
      and &ldquo;come and fiddle with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start here,&rdquo; he said, opening the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      We read for a while in concert. As usual my arm seemed to swing of its
      separate will, I myself becoming all but comatose. By and by I perceived
      that Merivale had discontinued and was seated at one side with his
      instrument upon his knees. Then I perceived that I was no longer following
      the book. I closed my eyes and listened. As usual I heard the voice of my
      violin very much as though some other person had been the performer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found that I was playing a lot of bits from memory. I heard the light,
      quick tread of a gavotte which I had learned as a boy and meantime almost
      forgotten; I heard snatches from the chants the <i>Chazzan</i> sings in
      the synagogue; I heard the Flower Song from Faust mixing itself up with a
      recitative from Lohengrin. Then I heard the passionate wail of Chopin
      become predominant: the exquisite melody of the <i>Berceuse</i>, motives
      from <i>Les Polonaises</i>, and at length the impromptu in C-sharp minor&mdash;that
      to which I have alluded in the early part of this narrative, as
      descriptive of Veronika. Following it, came the songs that Veronika
      herself had been most prone to sing, Bizet, Pergolese, Schumann, morsels
      of German folk <i>liede</i>, old French romances. And ever and anon that
      phrase from the impromptu kept recurring. Every thing else seemed to lead
      up to it. It terminated a brilliant passage by Liszt. It cropped out in
      the middle of a theme from the Meistersinger. And with its every new
      recurrence, the picture of Veronika which it pre sented to my imagination
      grew more life-like and palpable, until ere long it was almost as though I
      saw her standing near me in substantial objective form. As I have said, I
      scarcely realized that it was I who played. Except for the sensation along
      my wrist as the bow bit the catgut, I believe I should have quite
      forgotten it. But now abruptly, without the least volition upon my part,
      my arm acquired a fresh vigor. The voice of my violin increased in volume.
      The character of the music underwent a change. From a medley of fragments
      it turned to a coherent, continuous whole. Note succeeded note in natural
      and inevitable sequence. I tried to recognize the composition. I could
      not. It was quite unfamiliar to me. Odd, because of course at some time I
      must have practiced it again and again. Otherwise how had I been able to
      play it now? It flowed from the strings without hitch or hesitancy. Yet my
      best efforts to place it were ineffectual. Doubly odd, because it was no
      ordinary composition. It had a striking individuality of its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      It began with laughter-provoking scherzo, as dainty as the pattering of
      April rain-drops, as riotous as the frolicking of children let loose from
      school; which, by degrees tempering to a quieter allegro, presently
      modulated into the minor, and necessarily, therefore, became plaintive and
      sentimental. For a while bar succeeded bar, fitful and undetermined, as if
      groping blindly for a climax. Next, a quick, fluttering crescendo, and an
      exultant major chord. This completed the first movement. The second began
      pianissimo upon the A and E strings, an allegretto full of placid
      contentment; again, a minor modulation; again, blind groping for a climax,
      this time more strenuous than before, tinged by a passion, impelled by an
      insatiable desire; adagio on G and D, still minor; then a swift return to
      major, a leap of the bow and fingers back to A and E, and on these latter
      strings a rhapsody expressive of the utmost possible human joy. Third
      movement andante, sober but still joyous; the music, which hitherto had
      been restless and destitute of an apparent aim, seemed to have caught a
      purpose, to have gained substance and confidence in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It proceeded in this wise for several periods, when sharply, without the
      faintest warning, it broke into a discordant shriek of laughter, the
      laughter of a demon whose evil designs had triumphed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though I had not recognized the composition, up to this point I had
      understood it perfectly. Its intrinsic lucidity carried the intelligence
      along. But henceforward I was mystified. The reason for the violent change
      of theme, time, and quality, I could not divine; nor could I appreciate,
      either, how the subsequent effects were produced or what they were meant
      to signify. My impression was, as I have said, that the laughter which my
      violin seemed to be echoing was demoniac laughter, the outburst of a Satan
      over his success, of a Succubus fastening upon his prey. Yet the next
      instant I was doubtful whether it was indeed laughter at all? Was it not
      perhaps the hysterical sobbing of a human being frenzied by grief? And
      again the next instant neither of these conceptions appeared to be the
      correct one. Was it not rather a chorus?&mdash;a chorus of witches?&mdash;plotting
      some fiendish atrocity?&mdash;chuckling over a vicious pleasantry?&mdash;now,
      whispering amicably together, now wrangling ferociously, now uniting in
      blood-curdling screams of delight? Whatever it might be, I could not
      penetrate its sense. I listened with deepening perplexity. I wished it
      would come to an end. But it did not occur to me to stop my arm and lay
      aside my bow. The music went on and on&mdash;until Merivale caught me by
      the shoulder and snatched my violin from my grasp. He was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The descent back to earth was too abrupt. It took me some time to gather
      myself together. &ldquo;Eh&mdash;what were you saying?&rdquo; I asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was saying, stop! Consider a fellow&rsquo;s nervous system. Where in the name
      of Lucifer did you learn that infernal music? Whom is it by?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;oh, I don&rsquo;t know whom it is by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It out-Berliozes Berlioz,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Is it his?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. I don&rsquo;t remember. I am tired. Let me rest a moment without
      talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;it was a terrible strain to listen to it. I am
      quite played out&mdash;feel as if&mdash;forgive the comparison&mdash;as if
      I had spent the last hour in a dentist&rsquo;s chair. However, for relief&rsquo;s
      sake, let&rsquo;s go to dinner. Are you aware that we haven&rsquo;t eaten any thing
      since early morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After dinner Merivale insisted that we should take a long walk &ldquo;to shake
      out the kinks,&rdquo; and after the long walk we were tired enough to return to
      our pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went straight to sleep; but my sleep was troubled. As soon as Merivale
      had said goodnight and extinguished the gas, memory began to repeat the
      music I had played. I heard it throughout my sleep. Every little while I
      would wake up and try to banish it by fixing my attention on other
      matters. But it kept thrumming away in my brain despite myself. I could
      not silence it. Merivale&rsquo;s reference to a dentist&rsquo;s chair was, if
      inelegant, at least a graphic one. I got as hopelessly irritated as I
      could have done with a score of dentists simultaneously grinding at my
      teeth. My very arteries seemed to be beating to its rhythm.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one fit of wakefulness, that lasted longer than its predecessors had
      done, I found myself unconsciously tattooing it upon the wall at my bed&rsquo;s
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you?&rdquo; Merivale&rsquo;s voice demanded from out of the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you asleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, no. That music you played&mdash;or rather, stray fragments of it,
      keep running through my brain. I haven&rsquo;t been able to sleep for a long
      while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s singular. It affects me the same way. I was just drumming it on
      the wall. I&rsquo;ve been trying to get rid of it all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has wonderful staying powers, for a fact. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re awake,
      though. Companionship in misery is sweet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I also feel rather more comfortable now that you have spoken. Do you
      know, it&rsquo;s an immense puzzle to me, that music? I can&rsquo;t imagine where or
      when I ever learned it. And yet it is not the sort of thing one would be
      apt to forget. I can&rsquo;t recognize the style even, can&rsquo;t get a clew to the
      composer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The style is emphatically that of Berlioz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so. But it can&rsquo;t be by Berlioz, because I never learned any thing
      by Berlioz at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; A pause. Then, &ldquo;Say, Lexow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t possible that it&rsquo;s original, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Original? How do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, an improvisation&mdash;a little thing of your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; oh, no, I never improvise&mdash;at least an entire composition,
      like that. Nobody does. It bears all the marks of careful workmanship. It
      must be something well-known that has temporarily slipped from my memory.
      It&rsquo;s too striking not to be well-known. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll go through my music
      and find it; and I&rsquo;ll wager it will turn out to be quite familiar. Only,
      it&rsquo;s extremely odd that I can&rsquo;t place it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why wait till to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we can&rsquo;t begin to-night, can we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? I say, let&rsquo;s begin right off. The cursed thing is keeping us
      awake, and there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any escape from it. We may as well
      utilize our wakefulness, as lie here doing nothing but toss about. I say,
      let&rsquo;s light the gas and go to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, I&rsquo;m agreeable. The sooner the better as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; cried Merivale.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang out of bed and lighted the gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall Mahomet go to the mountain or shall the mountain come to Mahomet?&rdquo;
       he inquired, blinking his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean shall we dress and adjourn to the other room? Or shall I bring
      your musical library in here, so that we can conduct our investigation
      without getting up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you please,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll move the mountain, then,&rdquo; he said, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made two or three trips, back and forth, bearing an armful of music as
      the fruit of each. The last folios deposited on the floor, &ldquo;Now, as to
      method,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;how shall we start? It will occupy us till
      doom&rsquo;s-day if we undertake to go through the whole of this. I suppose
      there are some composers we can eliminate <i>à priori</i>, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Wagner, Liszt, in particular, we needn&rsquo;t
      trouble with. I&rsquo;d keep an especially sharp eye out for Ruben-stein and
      Dvorak and Winiauski. It&rsquo;s fortunate that I&rsquo;ve preserved all the music
      I&rsquo;ve ever owned. We can&rsquo;t miss it if we&rsquo;re only patient enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here goes,&rdquo; he cried, thrusting a thick pile of music into my
      hands, and apportioning an equal amount to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were industrious. It is needless that I should tarry with the incidents
      of our search. At daybreak we had not yet quite finished, and we had not
      yet struck any thing that bore the slightest resemblance to the
      composition in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But little remains,&rdquo; said Merivale. &ldquo;In another five minutes we will have
      found it; or my first hypothesis was true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your first hypothesis?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that it was original&mdash;a lucubration of your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that, I tell you, isn&rsquo;t possible. I&rsquo;m not vain enough to imagine that
      I could improvise in such style, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t enter into a dispute, at any rate not till our present
      line of investigation is exhausted. Back to the saddle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a space we were silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Eh bien, mon brave!</i>&rdquo; cried Merivale at length. &ldquo;There goes the
      last of my half,&rdquo; and he sent a sheet of music fluttering through the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here is the last of mine,&rdquo; I responded, laying down Schumann&rsquo;s <i>Warum</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we are still in the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still in the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t possible that we have overlooked it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I haven&rsquo;t. I took pains with each separate page.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Likewise, I! Therefore. I congratulate you. I&rsquo;ll order a laurel wreath at
      the florist&rsquo;s, the first thing after breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! How many times need I tell you that I could not by hook or
      crook have made it up as I went along? The mere notion is ridiculous. It
      must have got lost, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, the notion that you once learned it, then forgot it,
      then played it off without a fault from beginning to end, is trebly
      ridiculous. It was ridiculous of us to waste our time hunting for it,
      also. I am entirely convinced that it is yours. Why not? Ideas have come
      to other people&mdash;why not to you? Yesterday while you played, you were
      excited and wrought up, and the result was that you had an inspiration. By
      Jove, you&rsquo;re lucky! It&rsquo;s enough to make you famous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Merivale, fancy the absurdities you are uttering. Do you seriously
      suppose anybody&mdash;even a regular composer&mdash;could take up his
      fiddle and reel off a complicated thing like that without once halting?
      Why, man, there are four or five distinct movements. You might as well
      pretend that a mere elocutionist could write an intricate epic poem
      without once pausing to make an erasure or find a rhyme, as that I, a
      simple instrumentalist, could have done this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s only oneway of settling the matter. We&rsquo;ll refer it to an
      authority. You jot down a few specimen bars on paper, and I&rsquo;ll submit it
      to your friend, Dr. Rodolph. Of course he will identify it at once, if it
      isn&rsquo;t yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that will satisfy you, well and good,&rdquo; I assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the forenoon, Merivale, having procured a stock of
      music-paper at a shop in the neighborhood, said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how rapidly
      a man can write music, but if it isn&rsquo;t too slow work, I&rsquo;d seriously
      counsel you to put down the whole thing, while you&rsquo;re about it. In fact
      I&rsquo;d counsel you to do so any how. If by hazard it is original, you know,
      you&rsquo;d better make a memorandum of it while it&rsquo;s still fresh in your mind.
      Otherwise you might forget it. That often happens to me. A bright idea, a
      felicitous turn of phraseology, occurs to me when I&rsquo;m away somewhere&mdash;in
      the horse-cars, at the theater, paying a call, or what-not&mdash;and if I
      don&rsquo;t make an instant minute of it in my note-book, it&rsquo;s sure to fly off
      and never be heard from again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t written a bar of music for such a long
      while that I don&rsquo;t know how hard I shall find it. But I used to make a
      daily practice of writing from memory, because it increases one&rsquo;s facility
      for sight-reading.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hummed the first two or three phrases softly to myself, beating time
      with my fingers; then drew up to the writing-table and commenced to set
      them down. At the outset I had considerable difficulty, was obliged, so to
      speak, to spell my way along note by note, and committed several blunders
      which I had to go back to and correct. But gradually my path grew smoother
      and smoother, until I was no longer conscious of effort; and at last I
      became so much absorbed and so much interested by what I was doing, that
      my hand sped across the paper like a machine performing the regular
      function for which it was contrived. I suppose mental activity always
      begets mental exhilaration; and that mental exhilaration in turn, when
      allowed to attain too high a pitch, always approaches the borderland of
      its antipode, on the principle that extremes meet. At any rate such was my
      experience in the present instance. At first, both mind and fingers were
      sluggish and moved laboriously. Then mind got into running order, and
      fingers lagged behind; then fingers caught up with mind, and for a while
      the two kept pace; then, finally, fingers spurted ahead and it was mind&rsquo;s
      turn to acknowledge itself left in the rear. Mental exhilaration gave
      place to bewilderment, as I saw that my hand was forging along faster than
      my thought could dictate, in apparent obedience to an independent will of
      its own&mdash;which bewilderment ripened into thoroughgoing mystification,
      as the hand dashed forward and back like a shuttle in a loom, with a
      velocity that seemed ever to be increasing. I had precisely the sensation
      of a man who has started to run down a hill, and whose legs have acquired
      such a momentum that he can not stop them: on and on he must submit to be
      borne until some outside obstacle interferes, even though a yawning chasm
      await him at the bottom. Toward the end I scarcely saw the paper on which
      I was writing; I am sure I saw nothing of the matter that I wrote. I said
      to myself, &ldquo;Of course you will find that all this stuff is incoherent and
      meaningless when you get through.&rdquo; But I waited passively till my hand
      should get through of its own accord, I made no endeavor to draw the rein
      upon it. Eventually it came to a standstill with a round turn. I was quite
      winded. I needed leisure in which to recover my equilibrium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Merivale&mdash;of whose presence I had become oblivious&mdash;crossed over
      and began gathering the scattered sheets of paper from the table. The
      sight of him helped to bring me to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;there it is. I don&rsquo;t suppose you can read it. I got so
      excited I hardly knew what I was about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he answered reassuringly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you for
      the trouble you&rsquo;ve taken. But what,&rdquo; he added abruptly, &ldquo;but what is all
      this that you have written?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what do you fancy? The music, of course, that you asked me to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; I mean this writing, this text, with which you have wound up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Writing? Text? What are you driving at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, here&mdash;this,&rdquo; he said handing me the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy upon me!&rdquo; I exclaimed, thoroughly amazed. &ldquo;I was not aware that I
      had written any thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last half dozen pages were covered with written words&mdash;blotted,
      scrawling, scarcely decipherable, but unmistakably written words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, certainly, this is most astonishing. Whatever it is, I have written
      it unawares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I dropped the manuscript and leaned back in my chair, dumbfounded by this
      latest development.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Merivale, &ldquo;is the point where the music ends and the words
      begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The music ended, the words began, just at that point where last night the
      shriek of malevolent laughter had interfered with the current of melody.
      From that point to the bottom of the last page not another bar of music
      was discernible&mdash;not a note of the incomprehensible witches&rsquo; chorus&mdash;simply
      words, words that I dared not read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is magic, this is ghost-work,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It appalls me. Look at it,
      Merivale. Does it make sense? Or is it simply a mass of scribbling without
      rhyme or reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; rejoined Merivale slowly, &ldquo;it seems to make sense. The penmanship
      is pretty blind, but the words appear to hang together. It begins, &lsquo;I
      walked re&mdash;re&mdash;reluctantly&rsquo;&mdash;next word very bad&mdash;&rsquo;I
      walked reluctantly&mdash;reluctantly&mdash;away&rsquo;&mdash;oh yes, that&rsquo;s it&mdash;&rsquo;away&mdash;from
      the house. By Jove, this is singular! Shall I go on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, go on,&rdquo; I said faintly. There was panic in my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Merivale continued, picking his way laboriously. The following is what he
      read.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> WALKED
      reluctantly away from the house after I saw her light put out. I hated so
      to leave her that it was as if a chain and ball had been attached to my
      ankle. I had reached a point on Second avenue about half the distance home
      when I halted. I had begun to feel sick. Suddenly my ears had begun to
      ring, my head to swim. I clutched at a lamppost to keep from falling. The
      ringing in my ears became louder and louder&mdash;a roar like that of a
      strong wind. A deathly nausea overcame me. I thought I was going to faint,
      perhaps to die. I held on to the lamp-post and tried to call out for help.
      I could not utter the slightest sound; my tongue clove to the roof of my
      mouth as it does in nightmare. I seemed to be growing weaker with every
      breath. The noise in my ears was like an unbroken peal of thunder. My
      brain went spinning around and around as if it had been caught in a
      whirlpool. Then all at once my breath began to come in quick short gasps
      like the breath of a panting dog or like the breath of a person who has
      taken laughing-gas. I closed my eyes and for how long I know not clung to
      the lamp-post, waiting for this internal upheaval to reach its climax. By
      degrees my breath returned to its normal state; the uproar in my ears
      subsided; my brain got quiet again. I felt as well as ever, only a bit
      startled, a bit shaky in the legs. I thought, &lsquo;You have had an attack of
      vertigo, a half fainting-fit. Now you would best hurry home.&rsquo; But&mdash;but
      to my unmingled consternation my body refused to act in response to my
      will. I was puzzled. I tried again. Useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had absolutely no control over my muscles. Experiment proved that I
      could not move a finger; experiment proved that I could not put forth my
      foot and take a step. I was horrified. Ah, I thought, this is a stroke of
      paralysis. For a second time I attempted to summon help. For a second time
      my tongue clove to the roof of my mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if all this horrified me, how much more horrified was I the moment
      after, when, in entire independence of my will, that body of mine which I
      had fancied paralyzed began to act of its own accord! began to march
      briskly off in a direction exactly opposite to that which I wished to
      follow! If I had been puzzled before, how much more hopelessly puzzled was
      I now! Experiment proved that I was as powerless to stop myself at
      present, as an instant since I had been to set myself in motion. I was
      appalled. I knew not what this phenomenon was due to or what it might lead
      to. It seemed precisely as though the chords connecting my mind and body
      had been severed, as though the will of another person had become the
      reigning occupant of my frame. A thousand frightful possibilities flashed
      upon my imagination. With this utter incompetency to govern my own
      movements, God knew what might happen. I might walk into the river; or I
      might&mdash;I might commit some irretrievable wrong. Helpless and
      irresponsible as I was, I might accomplish that which all the rest of my
      days I should repent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile I had moved on, until now I halted again. I looked around. I was
      in front of Veronika&rsquo;s house. I crossed the street, picked my way through
      the people who were seated upon the stoop, mounted the staircase, and rang
      Veronika&rsquo;s bell, wondering constantly what the cause and what the upshot
      of this adventure might be, and powerless to assert the least influence
      over my physical acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Veronika&rsquo;s voice sounded from behind the door, &lsquo;Is that you, uncle?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, it is I, my tongue replied of its own volition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The door opened. I saw Veronika with the knob in her hand. She looked
      surprised. My impulse was to take her in my arms and explain to her the
      strange accident that had befallen me. I could not. I had no more control
      over my body than I had over hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Veronika closed the door. She glanced up at my face. Her eyes filled with
      fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why, Ernest,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;what is it? What is the matter? Why do you
      look like this?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I paused to collect my utmost strength, then tried to speak. Total
      failure. Tried to reassure her with my eyes. Total failure: eyes as
      uncontrollable as the rest of my person. But impelled by that other will
      which had usurped the place of mine, I approached her and asked, &lsquo;What is
      your name?&rsquo; It was my voice, but it was not I, that asked the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, for the love of God,&rsquo; Veronika besought, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t act like this. Oh,
      my Ernest, what terrible joke are you playing? Don t make me think that
      you have gone mad.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What is your name?&rsquo; my voice repeated, stonily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My name? What can you mean? Oh God, what has come over my beloved?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her face was pale, her eyes were full of anguish. And I&mdash;I was
      impotent to comfort her. My heart went out to her with a great bound of
      love; but I was in irons, chained down, compelled to witness, forbidden to
      interfere with the action of this awful drama. For a third time my tongue
      repeated, &lsquo;Your name&mdash;tell me your name.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My name?&rsquo; she gasped. &lsquo;You know my name&mdash;Veronika. See, don&rsquo;t you
      recognize me, Ernest? I am Veronika, whom you are going to marry. Oh, my
      loved one, you are ill. What can I do to make you well?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tell me your surname,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My surname&mdash;why, Pathzuol. Oh, Ernest, say you know me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And your father&rsquo;s name?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My father&mdash;his name was Nicholas&mdash;but he is dead&mdash;died
      when I was a little girl. Oh, God, what does this mean?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Enough; come with me,&rsquo; said the devil whose victim I had become.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grasped her wrist and led her down the hallway. If Veronika was
      terrified, her terror could not have equaled mine. What deed was I now
      bent upon committing? She followed me passively. The expression of her
      eyes made my soul ache within me. How I longed to speak to her and soothe
      her. How I longed to step between her and myself, to protect her from this
      maniac in whose power she was. To be obliged to stand by and see this
      thing enacted&mdash;imagine the agony I suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I led her down the hallway and into the dining-room. Then I released her
      wrist, and crossed over to the sideboard. I opened the sideboard drawer
      and took out a long, keen knife. I tried the point and the edge of the
      knife upon my thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Are you&mdash;are you going to kill me, Ernest?&rsquo; I heard Veronika ask,
      very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I am going to kill you. Lead the way to your bed-chamber.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Veronika&rsquo;s hand clutched convulsively at her breast. She said nothing.
      She moved slowly back into the hall and thence into her bedroom, I
      following.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, for God&rsquo;s sake, stop and think what you are doing,&rsquo; she cried out
      suddenly, turning and facing me at the threshold of her room. &lsquo;Think,
      Ernest, that it is I, Veronika, whom you are going to kill. Think, oh my
      loved one, think how you will suffer if ever you come to and realize what
      you have done. Oh, is there no way for me to bring him to himself!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently she continued, &lsquo;But tell me first what I have done.&mdash;Oh, I
      can not bear to die until I know that you don&rsquo;t suspect me of having
      wronged you in any way. Oh, Ernest, oh, if you would only speak one word.
      Oh, my darling, do not kill me without speaking to me. Oh God, oh God! Oh,
      there, there, he is going to kill me; he will not speak to me. Oh, what
      have I done? Ernest, <i>Ernest!</i> Wake up&mdash;stop your arm&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      strike me. Oh God, God, God!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After it was over I dried my hands upon my handkerchief, turned out the
      gas in the hall, locked the door on the outside, put the key into my
      pocket, and went away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What remains for me to tell? The above is what Merivale read to me. The
      above is what I had written. Could I doubt its truth? I did not, I do not,
      at any rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am informed that a man once tried for murder and acquitted can not, as
      the lawyers put it, can not be placed in jeopardy again. But I am enough
      of a Jew to believe in eye for eye and tooth for tooth. I shall see to it
      that I do not escape that penalty which the law would have imposed upon
      me, had the facts I am now aware of come out at my trial. I shall see to
      it that the murderer of Veronika Pathzuol meets with the punishment which
      his crime demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has taken me a week to write out this account. I want the public to
      have it. No need to analyze the motives that prompt this wish. I shall
      confide the MS. to my friend Merivale with directions that it be printed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not think of any thing more that needs to be said.
